## Ecosystem skills — served, not stored

**Position (owner decision, 2026-07-30): Raven forwards skill content, it does not store it.**
That is the line this design holds, and it is verifiable from this repository:

**1. Nothing is stored.** Ecosystem skill bodies (`SKILL.md` playbooks and their companion files)
are not committed to this repository and are not shipped inside the Worker bundle. What is
committed is an address: `ecosystem-skills/MANIFEST.json` records, per source, the upstream
repository and a full commit SHA, and per file a path and git blob hash; `catalog/manifest.json`
additionally records a SHA-256 per file. Raven is never the source of record for this content and
must not become one — durable mirrors of it (an R2 bucket, a committed copy, a bundled copy) are
out of scope by decision, not by oversight.

**2. What exists while serving is transport, not a store.** A request causes the Worker to fetch
the file from `raw.githubusercontent.com` at the pinned commit, verify it against both recorded
digests, and return it. A colo edge cache, an in-isolate memo, and a gitignored build cache hold
copies in flight so the same bytes are not refetched per request. They are caches on a forwarding
path; upstream remains the source.

**3. Responses carry upstream content and provenance.** Whole-skill reads preserve upstream YAML
frontmatter. Companion-file reads include any upstream YAML frontmatter. Heading-section reads
return only the requested `##` section. The top-level `url` names the pinned main `SKILL.md`. Each
returned section names its exact pinned source in its own `url`. Whether the forwarded metadata and
source URLs satisfy each upstream license is an open question for counsel.

`scrubNonExposedRefs` removes model-facing references that are absent from Raven's manifest. Its
`scrubRetiredSkillRefs` pass affects 7 LumenLoop files and 1 Stellar Light file, and **no
OpenZeppelin file**. Its Scout-operation pass removes complete Markdown sections, rows, or list
items that name excluded paths.

Each source's own `LICENSE`/`NOTICE` file names are recorded in `MANIFEST.json`
(`license_files`) at the same pinned commit, as provenance that every upstream is licensed —
those files are not fetched, copied, or served.

Two derived facts about a skill ARE committed, because routing needs them: the one-line
`description` from a skill's YAML frontmatter (what `search` scores) and its `##` section headings
(how `skill.read` addresses parts of a body). Section prose, body excerpts, and body-derived
keyword bags are not committed — `test/skill-content-not-vendored.test.ts` is the standing guard
on that line.

## Vendored code: `src/catalog/vendor/`

`normalize.ts`, `search-scoring.ts`, and `json-schema-types.ts` are vendored (with documented
adaptations — see each file's header) from
[`@cloudflare/codemode`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cloudflare/codemode) **v0.4.2** — the
frozen snapshot the copies were taken from, not the version the Worker depends on (`package.json`
pins that separately). It is distributed under the MIT license:

## Other snapshot data

- `ecosystem-skills/catalog.json` — a factual snapshot of the public
  [stellarlight.xyz/api/skills](https://stellarlight.xyz/api/skills) ecosystem directory.
- `inventory/*.json` — interface metadata (operation names, descriptions, schemas) published by
  the upstream services themselves for consumption; regenerated by
  `scripts/refresh-inventory.mjs`. Partner-tier LumenLoop items are persisted as name-only stubs;
  partner-tier detail is never committed to this repository.
- `eval/corpus/` — self-authored corpora vendored from this project's own retired prior-art
  repos; provenance in `eval/corpus/PROVENANCE.md`.
- `public/*.png` — AI-generated images; provenance documented in `public/README.md`.
