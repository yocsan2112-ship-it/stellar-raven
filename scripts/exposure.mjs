/**
 * exposure.mjs — the build-time exposure exclusions, as shared DATA
 * (ADR-0003, research/decisions/0003-build-time-exposure-filtering.md).
 *
 * The manifest IS the exposed surface: an excluded item is simply never
 * emitted, and consumers are never told what the gateway cannot do. That
 * property only holds if EVERY emitter draws from one exclusion dataset —
 * build-catalog.mjs (manifest entries + skill sections), build-super-spec.mjs
 * (in-sandbox spec), description-notes.mjs (callable-name rewrites must not
 * mint names for excluded ops), and src/skills/source.ts (the scrub applied to
 * every skill body served at read time). This module is that dataset; the fail-loud drift guards that pin
 * it to the live inventories stay in build-catalog.mjs, which is the one
 * script that always sees the inventory inputs.
