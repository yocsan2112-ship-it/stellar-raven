# AGENTS.md — stellar-raven-codemode

Canonical repository instructions for Codex, Claude Code, and other coding agents. Keep this file
short, current, and operational. Put architecture, research, history, and task runbooks in the
linked docs and skills instead of accumulating them here.

## Project and source-of-truth map

This is a Cloudflare Workers MCP server exposing `search` and `execute` over Lumenloop, Stellar
Light/Scout, Stellar Docs (Algolia), and selected ecosystem skills. Model-authored JavaScript runs
in a networkless Dynamic Worker; host adapters own all service traffic, policy, and secrets.

- Read `PLAN.md` for current product scope and status, then `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the implemented
  request, catalog, scoring, sandbox, and auth design.
- Use `README.md` for connection and operator setup.
- Use `research/` for dated evidence and design context; it is not an instruction layer.
- This repo is self-contained, including usage collection and reporting under `usage/`. Two private
  sibling directories are auxiliary only: `~/Desktop/stellar-raven-aux-priv-report` (the owner's Sites
  publication checkout, refreshed by `scripts/sync-usage-site.mjs`) and
  `~/Desktop/stellar-raven-aux-priv-evidence` (production snapshots and figures). Never commit
  production counts here; never make this repo depend on either directory. See `usage/README.md`.
- Use `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` for repeatable task workflows. `.claude/skills` is the
  committed symlink to the same canonical directory.
- Use `.agents/TODO.md` for the own-repo work queue and `.agents/rounds/` for round ledgers.
  `.agents/README.md` says which note belongs where.
- `CLAUDE.md` imports this file. Do not duplicate shared rules there.

## Commands and verification

- Install reproducibly: `npm ci`. A fresh clone then needs **both** of the following before
  `npm run typecheck` is usable, because `env.d.ts` *and* `.dev.vars` are generated/gitignored:
  create a placeholder `.dev.vars` carrying the names CI uses (see the `.dev.vars` step in
  [`ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) — values are irrelevant, the names define `Env`'s secret
  members), then run `npm run typegen`. `typegen` alone is not enough: without `.dev.vars` it
  emits an `Env` missing every secret and typecheck still fails on `WORKOS_*`,
  `MCP_SERVER_SECRET`, and `DEV_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED`.
- Baseline validation for code changes: `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, and `npm run build`.
  `npm test` excludes `test/smoke/**`; add `npm run test:smoke` when touching `src/executor` or
  `src/demo` — it is the only lane exercising those paths against the assembled worker
  (unit tests import the modules directly; CI always runs both).
- Run the narrowest relevant eval or maintenance command in addition to the baseline; the selected
  skill defines the exact gate for eval, drift, golden-truth, improvements, and observability work.
- Scan before committing: `npm run secrets:scan -- --tree`.
- Do not start a second Wrangler process. Find the pane already running `npm run dev`
  (`herdr pane list`) and reuse it; read its bound URL from that pane's output.
- Generated outputs are rebuilt by their `package.json` scripts, never edited by hand.

## Coordination

- Agents, panes, and worktrees run under Herdr. Use the global `herdr` skill for the CLI contract;
  it is the authority on command syntax, lifecycle states, and ID handling. Confirm
  `HERDR_ENV=1` before any control command, and read IDs out of JSON responses rather than
  predicting them.
- Spawn a reviewer or a parallel lane by splitting a pane from your own —
  `herdr pane split --current --direction <right|down> --cwd "$PWD" --no-focus`; `--direction` is
  required — then `herdr agent start <name> --kind <codex|grok|claude> --pane <id> -- <cli args>`.
  Name the model and effort explicitly after `--`. Wait with `herdr agent wait <name>` or
  `herdr agent prompt … --wait`; do not poll.
- **Pane and agent ownership is recursive:** control only the pane you occupy and panes you
  split yourself. Never close, interrupt, restart, send input to, rename, move, focus, resize, or
  take over a parent, a sibling, an unrelated pane, or another agent's descendants. Apply the same
  rule to every sub-agent. Idleness, staleness, a completed handoff, or a request to clean up does
  not transfer ownership: leave a pane you do not own alone and ask its owning agent to reconcile
  it. Record the pane IDs you create; unknown provenance means not owned. If the owner is unknown
  or unavailable, ask the user for an explicit exception naming the exact target; never adopt it.
- `herdr agent read` cannot recover output that scrolled off an alternate screen. For any reviewer
  whose findings matter, have the agent write them to a Markdown file and reply with only the path.
- Durable working state lives in the repository, never in an external tracker. Own-repo work goes
  to `.agents/TODO.md`; a multi-lane round keeps its ledger at
  `.agents/rounds/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.md`. See `.agents/README.md` for the routing table.
- Independent adversarial review is a completion gate when requested: reviewer must differ from
  author, run to completion, and have every finding reconciled before finalization.

## Model routing for repo-work fan-out

Launch fan-out through Herdr panes, one agent per lane. State model and effort explicitly on the
`herdr agent start` command line: Sol high for hard implementation/analysis, Terra high for routine
implementation or bounded verification, Fable high for product/API/taste, Opus high as the stable
Claude fallback, and Grok high for vendor-diverse assumption attack. Reserve max for frontier work
or a failed high-effort pass; treat ultra as a separate delegated topology. Callable-runtime
evidence lives in `research/agent-model-roster.md`. Eval answering and judge models remain separate
measurement contracts controlled by `run-evals`.

Choose the independent reviewer under "Coordination" by lane, not by a fixed model:

- **Eligibility.** The reviewer differs from the author *and* from the orchestrator. An
  orchestrator that is also a candidate reviewer drops out of the pool for that gate.
- **Effort.** Run the gate at high. Escalate to xhigh only for a subtle change, or after a
  high pass missed a real finding. Never make xhigh the standing default.
- **Selection and fallback.** Match the lane to the change: Fable for product, API, and taste;
  Sol for dense implementation or analysis; Grok for vendor-diverse assumption attack. When that
  lane is the author, the orchestrator, or unavailable, take the next best match, then Opus high
  as the last resort. Record the lane and effort used, and why the matched lane was skipped.

`research/agent-model-roster.md` holds the callable-runtime evidence for these lanes.

## Hard rules

- **Forward-only:** prefer the best current design; do not add compatibility shims, dual formats,
  or deprecation paths merely to preserve deployed behavior. Deviations still need evidence.
- **The manifest is the exposed surface** (ADR-0003). Model code never owns endpoints, arguments,
  auth, or exposure. Never emit references to non-exposed operations or retired skills. Two guards
  enforce this: `assertNoNonExposedRefsInText` runs in `prebuild` (via `build-micro-map.mjs`) over
  emitted text, and `assertNoNonExposedRefs` checks manifest entries when the catalog is rebuilt
  (`build-catalog.mjs`) and on every `npm test`. `npm run build` alone does NOT rebuild the catalog,
  so a hand-edited manifest is caught by `npm test`/CI rather than by the build.
- Keep exact-match resolution for skill/tool IDs. Preserve service distinctions among soft-empty,
  error, and data responses.
- **Secrets stay host-side:** never print, commit, or expose credentials to the sandbox;
  `globalOutbound` remains `null`.
- The paid Lumenloop research trigger and its account-scoped read operations remain unexposed.
  Enabling them requires the exposure change, partner-detail persistence, budget gate, and dedup in
  one reviewed change.
- Partner-tier Lumenloop details are never committed. Inventory keeps name-only stubs and skill
  sync remains keyless.
- Any paid or side-effecting model operation requires host-side request-context approval,
  elicitation, and budget enforcement before it can ship.
- Algolia operator credentials are maintenance-only and never a runtime/sandbox surface. Any write
  needs a read-only A/B win, a general mechanism rather than per-query hacks, and the guardrails in
  `research/services/stellar-docs-algolia.md`.
- Evals produce evidence-backed upstream findings in `improvements/`; scores are instruments, not
  the final product.
- Solo is retired (2026-08-25). Never add a `solo://` reference, a Solo todo, or a Solo scratchpad
  as a live path. Existing Solo references inside dated records — eval round notes, `improvements/`
  evidence, `research/`, `ideas/` — are historical provenance for work that really happened there;
  leave them, and do not rewrite evidence to match current tooling.
- Retired sibling repos must not be referenced as live paths. Retained prior art is read-only under
  `eval/corpus/`; it is also the routing eval's committed label source. The QA battery is owned
  under `eval/qa/corpus/` and does not read it. Use `research/prior-art.md` for history.

## Task runbooks

Use the matching skill when the task triggers it:

- `herdr` (global) — pane, agent, and worktree control; the authority on the `herdr` CLI contract.
- `truth-maintenance` — coordinate a full live-drift/eval/golden/improvements maintenance pass.
- `live-drift-resolution` — regenerate, classify, verify, and resolve live catalog drift.
- `run-evals` — select instruments, review verdicts, triage causes, and file findings.
- `improvements-pipeline` — maintain finding lifecycle, intake, probes, index, and upstream follow-up.
- `golden-truth` — change golden answers with provenance and explicit uncertainty.
- `cloudflare-observability-review` — investigate production logs, traces, telemetry, and Ray IDs.
- `audit-reviewability` — audit or repair reviewability debt in code, comments, documentation,
  tests, agent instructions, and generated changes.

Add durable repo-wide rules here only after recurring friction. Put specialized instructions in the
closest relevant skill or directory-level `AGENTS.md`.

## Definition of done

- The diff is scoped and preserves unrelated work in the dirty tree.
- Proportionate tests and required skill gates pass; failures are reported, not hidden.
- Generated artifacts came from scripts and secrets scanning passed where required.
- Requested independent reviews completed and every finding was reconciled.
- Documentation describes current behavior and links dated research instead of embedding history.
