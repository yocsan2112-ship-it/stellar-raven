# update.sh — re-pin the Stellar/Soroban ecosystem agent skills.
#
# This resolves a commit per source, walks its tree, and records the pin
# (commit + per-file path/size/git-blob-sha) in MANIFEST.json. It vendors
# NOTHING: skill bodies never enter the repo. It does FETCH bodies at the end —
# to print the old-pin -> new-pin body diff for review, and for build-index.mjs
# to read frontmatter — into the gitignored ecosystem-skills/.cache/. The pin is the whole
# artifact — the builders and the Worker fetch each file from
# raw.githubusercontent.com at the pinned commit and verify it against the
# blob sha recorded here (scripts/lib/skill-mirror.mjs, src/skills/source.ts).
#
# Sources, each grouped under <source>/<skill>/ in the manifest:
#
#   lumenloop            github  lumenloop/lumenloop-skills        (8 public skills)
#   openzeppelin-stellar github  OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-skills  (3 Stellar skills, cherry-picked)
#   stellar-dev          github  stellar/stellar-dev-skill         (7 SDF skills)
#   stellar-light        github  Stellar-Light/stellar-scout       (1 skill, repo root)
#   trustless-work       github  Trustless-Work/trustlesswork-skill (1 skill dir at the repo root, cherry-picked)
#
# Public sources ONLY, no credentials. The lumenloop-api partner source (6
# partner skills from the private lumenloop-api-skills repo, fetched via the
# credentialed /v1/skills/archive/partner endpoint) was REMOVED 2026-07-06:
# the skills were retired from catalog exposure 2026-07-03 (Solo todo 825,
# RETIRED_ONBOARDING_SKILLS in scripts/exposure.mjs), their description
# harvest is complete, and partner-tier content must not live in this public
# repo. Do NOT re-add a credentialed source here — this script staying
# keyless is what guarantees future agent-run syncs can never pull
# partner-confidential content into the repo.
#
# Each GitHub source's upstream LICENSE/NOTICE file NAMES are recorded in the
# manifest (provenance, not redistribution — nothing is copied here). See
# THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md at the repo root for the source-by-source license map.
#
# It also snapshots the stellarlight.xyz/api/skills DIRECTORY (≈30 ecosystem
# entries across sources/kinds) into catalog.json — the "what exists in the
# ecosystem" map, NOT downloaded as skills.
#
# Each source pins its own commit/ref + synced_at in MANIFEST.json. INDEX.md is
# regenerated via build-index.mjs.
#
# Usage:
#   ./update.sh            # re-pin every source at its default branch
#
# Requires: gh (authenticated), jq, node, curl, git. No API keys.
