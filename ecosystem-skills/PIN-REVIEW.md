# Skill pin review ledger

Skill bodies are **prompt input**: what they say becomes instructions the model follows. They are
not vendored here, so a re-pin commit shows only hash changes — the text itself never appears in
`git diff` the way it did when the bodies were checked in. This ledger is the replacement gate.

**Every commit that changes what `MANIFEST.json` serves must add an entry here naming the new
`sel:` digest.** `scripts/check-pin-review.mjs` enforces it in CI, and it is a review record, not
a formality: the entry attests that a human read the body diff `ecosystem-skills/update.sh`
printed.

The `sel:` digest covers a source's whole selection — commit, skill names, file paths, and per-file
blob shas — not just its commit. Retargeting an entry to a different file inside the same pinned
tree, or adding/dropping a selected skill, changes which prompt input is served without moving the
commit, so the commit alone is not what the gate can key on. Print the current digests with
`node scripts/check-pin-review.mjs --digests`.

Three details the gate is strict about, each because the loose version was walkable:

- **The entry must be NEW in this diff.** An attestation that already existed at the base ref does
  not count. Reverting to a previously reviewed selection is still a decision to serve those bytes
  again today.
- **It must be a real `sel:` token.** A bare 12-hex string is not enough — this file is full of
  40-hex commit SHAs that contain one.
- **Removing a source needs an entry too**, since it changes everything that source served. Record
  it as `removed: <source-id>` with the reason.

Do **not** paste skill text into this file — that would re-create the vendored copy this design
removes. Summarize what changed and why it is safe to serve.

## Procedure

```bash
./ecosystem-skills/update.sh             # re-pins, prints the old->new body diff AND the new digests
node scripts/diff-pins.mjs <old> <new>   # re-print the diff on demand
node scripts/check-pin-review.mjs --digests   # the sel: digests to record
# then add an entry below, rebuild the generated artifacts, and commit together
```

What to look for in the diff, beyond "is it accurate": instructions that try to change the
agent's behavior outside the skill's topic, references to non-exposed operations or retired
skills, claims about this gateway's own capabilities, and anything resembling injected
instructions ("ignore previous", "you must", credentials, URLs to fetch).

## Entries

### 2026-07-30 — baseline (no pin movement)

| Source | Pinned commit | Selection | Reviewed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `lumenloop` | `d92c56bda17ab702d3202335cfe814d64e70e191` | `sel:a9447c2ec930` | baseline |
| `openzeppelin-stellar` | `6f215af60eb60017ab1a933ce9d22a479cd42b26` | `sel:4c4191f30c20` | baseline |
| `stellar-dev` | `52baea1d8cb1aa9441004ce44b723f55cbc90901` | `sel:d5e23e3d6eaa` | baseline |
| `stellar-light` | `f2659ff63cd891d48f6adeb024de7753bd9efb9f` | `sel:3ad627307640` | baseline |

These are the pins in force when the ledger was introduced; they were already serving and are
recorded here so the CI check has a starting state. The gate applies to every change after this
entry. The `sel:` column was added when the gate widened from commit-only to the whole served
selection; the digests are of the same pins already listed, not a re-pin.

### 2026-08-10 — stellar-dev re-pin (drift issue #19)

| Source | Pinned commit | Selection | Reviewed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `stellar-dev` | `9e3d3fe0de8587205b020e0148ea67525e38e494` | `sel:5f80e607aef7` | read + independently reviewed |

The other three sources did not move; their selections are unchanged from the baseline entry.

**What the selection gained.** A new skill, `cross-chain` (`SKILL.md`, `axelar.md`, `cctp.md`) —
CCTP V2, Axelar GMP/ITS, and NEAR Intents routing for Stellar. This is a new **exposed** surface:
the served skill count goes 19 → 20 and the catalog goes 276 → 283 entries (18 → 19 searchable
skills, 204 → 210 sections). It is filed into the `stellar-appdev` group in `groups.json`.

**What changed in already-served bodies.**

- `zk-proofs` — a status rewrite, not a rewording: CAP-0074 (BN254 base ops) and CAP-0075
  (Poseidon/Poseidon2 permutations) move from "proposed" to Final/Protocol 25+, CAP-0080 (BN254 G1
  MSM, Fr arithmetic, on-curve checks) is added at Protocol 26+, and the Noir and RISC Zero
  walkthroughs flip from attestation-oracle workarounds to on-chain verification.
- `standards` — the same CAP status corrections, plus a new K2 money-market section carrying ~20
  pubnet contract addresses dated 2026-07-31.
- `agentic-payments` — MPP "Channel mode" renamed "Session mode" (channel-backed), plus corrected
  `mppx` import paths, per-route handlers, and SDK version-alignment notes.
- `data` — drops the flat "Infinite Scroll queries back to genesis" claim; deep `getLedgers`
  history is now correctly framed as a property of the provider's data lake, bounded by
  `getHealth().oldestLedger` on a plain instance.

**Why it is safe to serve.** Reviewed by the author against the printed body diff and
independently by a separate agent (Solo scratchpad 795, Lane A) reading the old/new bodies
directly. No behavior-hijack directive, no "ignore previous"-class instruction, no literal
credential, and no reference to a non-exposed operation or a retired skill; every related-skill
link resolves to an exposed manifest entry, and the companion files are emitted as
`skills.stellar-dev.cross-chain#file:axelar.md` / `#file:cctp.md`. The gateway self-description in
`standards` is pre-existing, accurate, and unchanged by this pin. The CAP status claims were
corroborated against primary sources — the stellar-protocol CAP index and CAP documents, the
official ZK docs, and a live Horizon root reporting `current_protocol_version: 27` — rather than
taken on the vendor's word; the Nethermind UltraHonk and RISC Zero verifier claims were confirmed
at source level (the contracts import the CAP-0080 host functions they say they need) but not
built or executed here.

**Bounded risks accepted, recorded so they are not rediscovered as surprises.** Three of the new
and changed bodies direct the reader to re-check mutable external sources (Circle's token/Fast
matrices, the NEAR 1Click API docs, Axelar's on-chain registries and Axelarscan, K2's contract
page). That is correct staleness hygiene for fast-moving rails, but it is external prompt input and
does not outrank system or developer instructions. `cctp.md` also points at a third-party demo repo
with an install-and-run command — the only supply-chain execution prompt in the selection. The K2
addresses are upstream's word as of their stated date; treat the linked contract page as the source
of truth before anything hard-codes them.

### 2026-08-14 — stellar-dev and stellar-light re-pin (drift issue #20)

| Source | Pinned commit | Selection | Reviewed |

| `stellar-dev` | `812598a8538dc5479196145d2175b4a991bee1d9` | `sel:7aa692ae3f4e` | read in full |

The `stellar-dev` selection changes 18 files. It splits four large skills into eight companion
files. It adds trustline-removal checks, durable Horizon cursor guidance, and contract-build
diagnostics. It also shortens the `zk-proofs` routing description.

The `stellar-light` selection changes two reference files. It documents new read-only filters,
code-evidence fields, confidence semantics, and current `smart-contracts` skill links.

The full old-pin to new-pin body diff was reviewed. The changed text contains no credential,
behavior-hijack instruction, retired skill, or non-exposed Raven operation reference. The new
companion files preserve the existing topics and make section reads smaller.

### 2026-08-19 — stellar-light re-pin

The other three sources did not move. Their selections remain unchanged from the preceding entry.

The new selection documents useful read-only composite operations. Raven now exposes the
Hackathon Build Brief.

The raw skill also advertises `POST /api/feedback` and `GET /api/feedback`. The prior selection
already advertised both operations. Raven excludes the write because it is side-effecting. Raven
also excludes its schema-only read because the write is unavailable.

Raven applies one manifest-derived exposure filter to every selected file at build and read time.
The filter removes a complete Markdown section, table row, or list item that names an excluded
Scout path. It fails closed for an unsafe prose shape. This selection passed the guard across all
four files. Raven serves no feedback workflow from the pinned body.

### 2026-08-19 — stellar-dev re-pin (skills findings sk-016 and sk-017)

| Source | Pinned commit | Selection | Reviewed |

| `stellar-dev` | `1f4b94e01ca24a2c00cb3b2cb3fcf6d07ad76462` | `sel:d9d847463c64` | complete old-to-new body diff read |

The other three sources did not change their served selections.

Five files changed. `agentic-payments/SKILL.md` and `agentic-payments/mpp.md` add MPP discovery,
the runtime 402 Challenge authority rule, and optional registries. `dapp/smart-accounts.md`,
`standards/ecosystem.md`, and `standards/resources.md` replace archived repository links and
describe both smart-account kits as supported siblings with different authorization models.

The changes stay within each skill's topic and match upstream PRs 109 and 110. They add no
credential, behavior-hijack instruction, retired skill, or non-exposed Raven operation reference.
The external OpenAPI, registry, SDK, and repository links are relevant reference material.

### 2026-08-25 — stellar-light re-pin (drift issue #35)

The other three sources did not change their served selections.

One API reference file changed. It documents the exact project `type` filter and the new
read-only `GET /api/projects/resolve` operation. The resolver defines conservative miss,
supersession, and unsourced-status semantics.

The changes stay within the Scout skill's topic. They add no credential or behavior-hijack
instruction. The API reference omits the live `matchedOn: "repo"` value for the new resolver.
Raven filters the resolver text and keeps that operation unexposed because OpenAPI leaves its
nested identity and evidence objects untyped. Finding `sls-075` tracks both contract gaps.

### 2026-08-25 — stellar-dev and stellar-light re-pin (skills finding sk-020)

| Source | Pinned commit | Selection | Reviewed |

The other two sources did not change their served selections.

Two files changed.

`stellar-dev/standards/resources.md` replaces the community Discord invite. The old
`discord.gg/stellar` vanity code is held by an unrelated guild and lands in a channel named
`🚨・security-trap`. The new `discord.gg/stellardev` resolves to the "Stellar Developers" guild, which
`developers.stellar.org` also links. This is the fix for finding `sk-020`; it is why this re-pin
happened. Upstream merged it as PR 114. The pinned commit is the PR head and is an ancestor of
`main`; the merge commit carries the same selected tree.

`stellar-light/stellar-scout/references/api-reference.md` adds the `matchedOn: "repo"` value to the
resolver contract and adds a `q` free-text filter to the skills-catalog description. The
`matchedOn` addition closes half of the contract gap that finding `sls-075` recorded on 2026-08-25.
`GET /api/projects/resolve` stays unexposed, so Raven still filters that resolver text.

Both changes stay within their skill's topic. They add no credential, behavior-hijack instruction,
retired skill, or non-exposed Raven operation reference. The catalog diff for this re-pin is
provenance only: commits, blob hashes, content digests, and timestamps.

The other three sources did not change their served selections.

One API reference file changed. It adds exact guidance for the `corrected`, `semantic`, and `all`
project-search match modes. It also adds sections for `GET /api/quality` and `GET /api/verify`.

The changes stay within the Scout skill's topic. They add no credential, behavior-hijack
instruction, or retired skill. Raven still excludes both new sections through the shared Scout
operation and skill-body exposure filter. The build and skill-scrub guards verify that the served
skill cannot advertise either excluded path.

The other three sources did not change their served selections.

The selection expands the MPP and x402 guides with production patterns and fail-closed setup.
It adds asset verification guidance and a LayerZero companion to the cross-chain skill.
The LayerZero guide keeps transaction submission behind explicit user signing agreement.

An independent Claude Fable high reviewer read all five changed `stellar-dev` files and their diffs.
The reviewer verified every new blob hash, checked the added links, and checked mutable claims.
The changes contain no credential, behavior-hijack instruction, retired skill, or excluded operation.
The round ledger records the reviewer, evidence, and bounded external-claim risks.

Findings `sk-023` and `sk-024` still reproduce at this pin.
Their status remains `verified`, and this change records dated recurrence evidence.

### 2026-09-09 — isolated stellar-dev acceptance from issue #141

| `stellar-dev` | `0472452a05731de5e0a1e886d8aae6df24873fe2` | `sel:7b68c8b72b2f` | All four changed body diffs read |

The Astra author and parent read all four changed stellar-dev body diffs.
The independent Grok 4.6 high reviewer read those diffs and verified the source claims.
The other three source selections remain unchanged.
The root and reviewer each fetched and verified all 44 selected files without the cache.

The stellar-dev changes separate x402 facilitator requirements from protocol requirements.
They explain the general MPP protocol and update the Soroban SDK example to version 27.
The changes contain no literal credential, instruction override, retired skill, or excluded Raven operation reference.
The live source hashes match the selected bodies.
The source audit confirms stable soroban-sdk 27.0.6 and Mainnet protocol 27.
It confirms MPP payment-method-agnostic scope and the public x402 facilitator's Stellar testnet-only support.
The audit does not claim a compiled Rust example or a payment test.

The combined Scout candidate remains rejected and does not ship.
Its OpenAPI omits the live `issued-single-holder` RWA state.
The accepted Scout inventory and Stellar Light selection remain byte-identical to the base.

The isolated candidate passes the routing gate, 1995 tests, and 85 smoke tests.
All routing thresholds and accepted totals remain unchanged.
The catalog evidence fingerprint changes. Incidental ranking changes cause no grade losses.
The acceptance review is `.agents/rounds/2026-09-09-skill-pin-acceptance-grok.md`.
The source audit is `.agents/rounds/2026-09-09-upstream-handoffs-grok.md`.
The rejected candidate remains documented in `.agents/rounds/2026-09-09-drift-141-astra.md`.
This entry approves the isolated pin for merge, not production deployment or finding retirement.

### 2026-09-15 — trustless-work source added

| Source | Pinned commit | Selection | Reviewed |

| `trustless-work` | `634f32bd4be6769b0cae52e72db4899d5f5a069c` | `sel:7c6d71f8eef2` | independent Grok 4.6 high review complete |

The four existing sources did not move; their selections are unchanged.

**What the selection serves.** A new source: [Trustless-Work/trustlesswork-skill](https://github.com/Trustless-Work/trustlesswork-skill),
the Trustless Work escrow-integration skill (Escrow-as-a-Service on Stellar). The repo holds one
skill directory, `trustless-work-dev/`, at the repo ROOT — pinned with the new `path: "."` mode
(skill dirs at the repo root, cherry-picked; the sibling `scripts/` dir is recorded under
`unpinnedUpstream`). The selection is 22 files: the `SKILL.md` router, a constitution of protocol
invariants, and companion files for the escrow REST API (production V1 and testnet-only beta V2),
React SDK hooks, JS SDK, and the pre-built Blocks UI. This is a new exposed surface: the
mirrored/pinned skill count goes 20 → 21 (`lumenloop-mcp-connect` stays retired from serving), and
the served catalog goes 253 → 282 entries (19 → 20 searchable whole skills, 174 → 202 sections).
It is filed into the new `ecosystem-platforms` group in `groups.json`.

**Review result.** The contributing author and an independent Grok 4.6 high reviewer inspected the
source selection. The independent reviewer differs from the author and orchestrator. The reviewer
accepted all 22 selected files, source boundaries, hashes, external links, and authentication scope.
The selected bodies contain no instruction override, literal credential, retired skill, or
non-exposed Raven operation reference. The beta authentication conflict remains recorded in
`improvements/skills/sk-025-trustless-work-beta-auth-scope.md`.

The complete routing comparison covers 544 rows. Fourteen normal-dump rows and one holdout row
change ordered identities. No movement adds Trustless Work to an unrelated query. The independent
reviewer accepted all 15 movements without a threshold, label, or scorer change. Current totals are
legacy `213/280/314`, skills `16/23/23`, and holdout `10/22/27` with 11 forbidden captures. Every
committed numerical baseline and accepted total remains unchanged. The durable review is
`.agents/rounds/2026-09-16-trustless-work/source-review.md`. The decision ledger is
`.agents/rounds/2026-09-16-trustless-work-acceptance.md`.

**Bounded risk accepted, recorded so it is not rediscovered as a surprise.** The Blocks UI files
instruct installing and running the vendor's own published packages (`npm install
@trustless-work/blocks`, `npx trustless-work <component>`) — a supply-chain execution prompt of the
same class already recorded for `cctp.md` in the 2026-08-10 entry.

### 2026-09-16 — Light skill paired with Scout 1.9.52, RWA excluded

| Source | Pinned commit | Selection | Reviewed |

The selection changes two skill files. The other four source selections stay unchanged.
Open RFPs now mean soliciting briefs; `meta.scfRound` determines the current submission window.
Repository scores use code evidence. Funding is one input, not a gate.
Missing hackathon submission records remain `null`, not zero.
Partner filters add `asset-issuer` and explain `accepting=0`.

This pin requires the reviewed Scout 1.9.52 inventory and the existing exposure scrub.
`GET /api/rwa` remains excluded. The scrub removes its new reference section.
The scrub also removes the new block quote about the unavailable bare `/api/repos` path.
The `/api/repos/search`, `/api/repos/explain`, and `/api/repos/trust` references remain available.
No new operation becomes callable. No runner declares a changed Scout operation.
No active golden answer needs a change from these surviving claims.

The parent read the generated body diff. Grok independently checked the source and emitted bytes.
See [the pairing review](../.agents/rounds/2026-09-16-truth-maintenance/light-pin-excluded-rwa-review.md).
This entry records source review only. Routing acceptance and production verification remain separate gates.
