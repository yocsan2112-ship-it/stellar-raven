/**

 * not the whole string — is what the model reads while it decides how to call

 *
 * The upstream documentation URLs — one official link per source family — are
 * trailing reference metadata and provide no runtime guidance. They therefore
 * belong after the behavior contract rather than inside the clipped prefix.
 *
 * These tests hold both invariants. Each clipped prefix must still carry the
 * rules the model acts on — search's plan-then-compose workflow, including the
 * open-world half of its breadth rule, and execute's envelope contract and
 * `## Rules` opener. The URLs must ship in the full description and must not
