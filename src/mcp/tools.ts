/**
 * MCP tool registration for the unified `search` + `execute` server.
 *
 *  - `search`  → host-side ranked search over the generated catalog
 *                (catalog/manifest.json), as defined by ADR-0001. The
 *                `execute` sandbox also provides `codemode.spec()`,
 *                `codemode.search()`, and `codemode.catalog()`. These helpers
 *                keep discovery in one model turn. Operation hits carry
 *                rendered TypeScript signatures.
 *  - `execute` → runs LLM JavaScript in a Dynamic Worker sandbox via
 *                the injected `runExecute` (src/executor/run.ts, wired
 *                by src/server.ts). The runner is INJECTED because run.ts
 *                imports @cloudflare/codemode (→ cloudflare:workers),
 *                which plain-Node vitest cannot load; without a runner
 *                the tool degrades to an error-as-data explanation.
 *                Errors never cross the tool boundary as throws (PLAN §4).
 *
 * The `execute` description mirrors upstream's REQUEST_TYPES template
 * (node_modules/@cloudflare/codemode/dist/mcp.js), adapted to the
 * multi-service super spec; deltas are documented in
 * research/super-spec-design.md §5.

export const SEARCH_DESCRIPTION = `Ranked lexical search over every exposed service operation (lumenloop.*, scout.*, stellarDocs.*) and whole skill. Skill sections are exact-read affordances exposed on whole-skill hits through availableSections; they are not independent ranked hits.

Returns TypeScript signatures, \`confidence\`, and \`recoveryMetadata\`. Unresolved one-content-token queries can add directory \`widerCandidates\` even with gated hits. Unresolved means no operation-name token match. Zero-hit/all-backfill pages can add broad semantic/research/A/V/corpus advice. Advice never changes ranking. Pass attempted exact IDs in \`recoverFrom\` (optional \`reason\`) for separate recovery candidates.

## Workflow

1. Plan which source families could ground the answer before searching:
${FAMILY_LINE}
Most questions have a primary family and a corroborating one — pick both up front.
2. \`search\` once per candidate family — searches are cheap: two or three targeted queries (with \`service\`/\`kind\` filters where the family is known) beat one broad phrase. Vary vocabulary between queries: an entity name first, then a capability phrase.
3. Read the top hits' signatures and descriptions.
4. Write ONE \`execute\` script that composes SEVERAL relevant operations — hits are composable building blocks, not one-answer routes. Fan out broad calls (often across services) with Promise.all, then make targeted follow-up calls from what comes back.

5. Match breadth to the claim: an exact directory/index lookup can answer a closed-world membership question, but an open-world identity, history, or obscure-topic question needs a broad content/research family in the same script.

6. For a design-stage request to create a new artifact, include one bounded prior-art pass before committing architecture: at most two Scout repo/project discovery calls, one focused detail call, and three returned candidates, alongside current official examples. For each candidate return exact URL, role/applicability, freshness/provenance, and limitations; license/audit/deployment/compatibility stay unknown unless source-backed. Use the pass for scope, pitfalls, and build-vs-integrate decisions; skip it for single-step how-tos and debugging.

## Rules

- Never guess operation or skill names — always discover them here first (or with \`codemode.search\` mid-script).
- Prefer targeted queries ("account trustlines", "soroban storage patterns") over broad ones, and vary vocabulary across candidate families.
- Use \`kind\` to narrow to \`operation\` or \`skill\`, and \`service\` to narrow to one namespace. Filter values are exact-match — an unknown \`service\` is rejected with the valid names, never silently empty.
- Each hit's \`tier\` says which scorer ranked it: "gated" (strict, primary) or "backfill" (gate-relaxed page fill for long queries). Scores share one scale; gated hits lead except a backfill hit may be promoted when it decisively dominates (>=1.6x). Hit order is authoritative.
- \`truncated: true\` means more entries matched (\`total\`) than the page shows — if nothing here fits, search again with a higher \`limit\`, the other candidate family, or varied vocabulary before concluding the capability is missing.
- Skill hits are operational playbooks and carry \`availableSections\` — read those sections via \`codemode.skill.read(id, { sections })\` inside \`execute\`.
- A few skills are also RUNNABLE — their hits additionally carry a \`signature\` whose callable line is \`codemode.skill.run("<exact id>", input)\`: one call inside \`execute\` that runs the skill's whole data-gathering pipeline and resolves to the standard { ok: true, data } | { ok: false, error } envelope.
- Operation signatures are compact: the input type and callable line are always complete, but a very large OUTPUT type is stubbed down to its top-level field names. When you need the full output shape (or the raw JSON schemas), call \`codemode.describe("<exact id>")\` inside \`execute\`.
- Deeper or arbitrary discovery lives inside \`execute\`: \`codemode.search(...)\` (this same ranked search, mid-script), \`codemode.describe(id)\` (one entry's full detail), \`codemode.catalog({ kind?, service?, compact? })\` (exact-filtered catalog data; default/full includes schemas, \`compact: true\` omits them), and \`codemode.spec()\` (the unified OpenAPI super spec) — use them for follow-ups without another tool round-trip.

${UPSTREAM_DOC_LINKS}`;

export const EXECUTE_DESCRIPTION = `Execute JavaScript in a sandboxed Worker isolate with access to the service SDKs discovered via the \`search\` tool.

Calls return one text result; failures set \`isError\`. The sandbox result, console output, and thrown errors each have a separate model-boundary cap of roughly 6k tokens by default. Service-call payloads live under \`.data\`. The sandbox has no direct network access, and \`fetch()\` fails.

Write an async arrow function in JavaScript that returns the result. One script should compose MANY operations: broad discovery calls first (in parallel where independent), then targeted deeper calls parameterized by their results, then return one merged, compact value.

Worked example (multi-service fan-out, then a follow-up detail call):

async () => {
  const [dir, docs] = await Promise.all([
    lumenloop.search_directory({ query: "soroswap", limit: 3 }),
    stellarDocs.search_docs({ query: "AMM liquidity pool", hitsPerPage: 3 })
  ]);
  let project = null;
  if (dir.ok && dir.data.projects.length > 0) {
    const detail = await lumenloop.get_project({ slug: dir.data.projects[0].slug, compact: true });
    if (detail.ok) project = detail.data;
  }
  return { project, docs: docs.ok ? docs.data.hits.map(h => ({ url: h.url, snippet: h.snippet })) : docs.error };
}

## Result envelope

Every service call resolves (never throws) to either { ok: true, data } or { ok: false, error: { service, kind, message, status?, hint? } } where kind is "error" (call failed / bad args) or "soft-empty" (the service answered with nothing — unknown slug, zero hits; NOT evidence). Check \`r.ok\` before using \`r.data\`. Payload fields live one level down — \`r.data.projects\`, never \`r.projects\`; reading a payload field directly on the envelope throws an Error naming the correct path. \`r.data\` on a failed call is undefined and logs a one-line \`[envelope]\` warning naming the error. Writes to the envelope are allowed.

## Rules

- The ONLY globals are \`lumenloop\`, \`scout\`, \`stellarDocs\`, \`codemode\`, and standard JavaScript. There is no \`host\`, \`fs\`, \`require\`, \`process\`, or Node.js API.
- Never guess method names — call an operation as \`<service>.<name>(args)\` exactly as the spec's operationId / x-execute line (or a search hit's signature) shows. Unknown names fail; there is no fuzzy resolution.
- Mid-script discovery: \`codemode.spec()\` returns the unified OpenAPI-style super spec covering every service ($refs resolved inline — paths keyed "/{service}/{operation}", operationId = the exact callable, x-execute = the exact sandbox call line); \`codemode.search("targeted query")\` (or \`{ query, kind?, service?, limit?, recoverFrom?, reason? }\`) for RANKED results plus advisory directory/broad-operation and exact-ID recovery candidates — resolves to { ok: true, hits, total, truncated, widerCandidates, recovery, confidence, recoveryMetadata }. \`confidence\` reports hit count, the absolute top-score gap, and both compared tiers. \`recoveryMetadata\` reports matching skills excluded only by a service filter. \`widerCandidates\` can add one directory recommendation for a one-content-token query without an operation-name token match, including gated pages. Zero-hit and all-backfill pages can add broad recommendations. This advice never changes ranking; \`recovery\` requires explicit \`recoverFrom\` ids. Truncated means more entries matched than returned (raise \`limit\`, try the other candidate family, or vary vocabulary — \`total\` is a floor, not exhaustive: it counts only the scorer tiers consulted for this page and can grow at a higher \`limit\`), and an unknown \`kind\`/\`service\`/\`recoverFrom\` value comes back as an error listing the valid scope; and \`codemode.catalog({ kind?, service?, compact? })\` for exact-filtered catalog data. Default/full entries include id, service, kind, description, inputSchema, outputSchema, and any retrievalProfile; \`compact: true\` omits the schemas. Everything listed is callable/readable. Use these for follow-ups instead of ending the script early.
- \`codemode.describe("<exact id>")\` is the canonical detail step after \`search\`: for an operation it returns the FULL rendered signature (complete output type, even where the search hit showed a compacted stub), the raw inputSchema/outputSchema as data, and a \`usage\` line; for a skill, its \`availableSections\` plus the skill.read call to make; for a skill section, the parent skill id, section key, and the exact skill.read call. Reach for it whenever a search hit's stub, description, or field names aren't enough to write the call or select payload fields.
- Skills are operational playbooks — tested build/integration/recovery procedures: \`codemode.skill.read("<exact skill id>", { sections: ["<section-slug>"] })\`; section keys come from search hits' \`availableSections\` or the spec's x-skill-index. \`{ sections }\` is the ONLY option (unknown option keys are rejected, not ignored). It resolves to { ok: true, id, content | sections, availableSections, notice? } — skill content sits at the TOP LEVEL of the result, not under \`.data\` (that envelope is for service calls); failures are { ok: false, error } as usual. Large reads come back whole for in-sandbox use (grep/aggregate freely) with an advisory \`notice\` — but RETURN sections or aggregates from the script, not whole bodies. Pair build skill sections with \`stellarDocs.search_*\` for current reference truth. When designing a new contract, app, integration, protocol, or infrastructure component, also run one prior-art pass in the SAME script: at most two \`scout.searchRepos\`/\`scout.searchProjects\` discovery calls, one focused detail call, and three returned candidates. Use it for scope, pitfalls, and build-vs-integrate decisions; return exact URL, role/applicability, freshness/provenance, and limitations, with license/audit/deployment/compatibility unknown unless source-backed. It is never API, security, maintenance, or production authority. Skip it for single-step how-tos and debugging; purely factual questions use docs first.
- A few skills are RUNNABLE: \`codemode.skill.run("<exact skill id>", input)\` executes that skill's data-gathering pipeline host-side in one call, resolving to the ordinary service-call envelope ({ ok: true, data } | { ok: false, error }) with \`data.calls\` auditing every constituent call it made — ids are exact-match (runnable search hits and \`codemode.describe\` show the exact callable line and input type), and \`skill.read\` on the same id still returns the prose playbook: run gathers the data, read carries the judgment steps.
- If a returned result is truncated, the visible tail is a source-basis block. When it says an artifact is available, call \`codemode.artifact.info(id)\` for metadata or \`codemode.artifact.read(id)\` for the full redacted result inside the same authenticated execute session; read it in the sandbox, then return a compact projection. Artifact reads resolve to the same envelope shape and are capped per execute.
- Do NOT use \`fetch\` — the sandbox has no network access; it will throw. All I/O goes through the service globals.
- Do NOT use TypeScript syntax — no type annotations, interfaces, or generics. Plain JavaScript only.
- Do NOT define named functions and then call them — just write the arrow function body directly.
- Parallelize independent calls with Promise.all; sequence only where a call needs a previous result.
- Directory/list-style results are summaries: most services pair them with a per-item detail operation (\`lumenloop.get_project\`, \`scout.getHackathon\`, \`lumenloop.get_document\`, …). When the question needs specifics beyond a list row, follow up with the detail call parameterized by the row — answering detail questions from a broad payload alone is a known failure mode.
- Evidence sufficiency is answer-level, not envelope-level. For a closed-world question (is X in this directory/index?), an exact empty may be reported only at that source's scope. For an open-world identity, history, or topic question, an ok call whose rows are empty, off-target, adjacent, or only semantic candidates grounds no negative conclusion — several such calls ground nothing together. Make one wider pass in the SAME script: use \`lumenloop.search_content_semantic\` for ecosystem content/events, \`scout.searchResearch\` for cited history, \`lumenloop.find_av_passages\` for spoken material, or \`stellarDocs.search_docs\` for official technical wording. After a successful profiled broad call, the host may append a standalone conditional checkpoint naming uncalled alternatives from the manifest recovery graph; it observes operation classes, not row relevance, so stop when exact evidence or the named closed-world answer already resolves the question and otherwise make at most one bounded alternative pass. Treat semantic rows as candidates: require exact identity or canonical slug plus source and date before attribution; otherwise return a scoped unverified result or ask for context.
- Avoid lossy list filtering: inspect row keys, call \`codemode.describe\` when output fields are unclear, and filter against raw row JSON or nested/common field variants before projecting compact columns. Projecting first can erase evidence and create false no-match answers.
- The final return value is truncated at the configured model-boundary cap (default ~6k tokens) — select fields, slice arrays, aggregate in-script, and read skills by section rather than returning raw payloads or whole skill bodies. console.log output comes back as logs.

export const BASE_SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS = `Unified Stellar-ecosystem gateway: \`search\` discovers service operations and skills. \`execute\` composes them in sandboxed JavaScript.

Workflow: classify claim scope; plan source families; \`search\` each family with vocabulary; write ONE \`execute\` script. Use Promise.all for independent calls, then follow up from results. Use \`codemode.describe("<exact id>")\` for stubbed schemas. Filter raw list rows (and nested field variants) before projecting compact columns. Read sections via \`codemode.skill.read(id, { sections })\`. Runnable skills use \`codemode.skill.run("<exact id>", input)\`; calls are in \`data.calls\`.

Every service call resolves to { ok: true, data } or { ok: false, error: { kind, message, hint? } }. Payloads live under .data (\`r.data.projects\`, never \`r.projects\`). error.kind is "error" or "soft-empty" (inconclusive, NOT evidence of absence). A closed-world exact empty applies only there. For an open-world identity, history, or topic question, ok rows that are empty, off-target, adjacent, or only semantic candidates are inconclusive: make one broad pass. Use \`lumenloop.search_content_semantic\` for content, \`scout.searchResearch\` for history, \`lumenloop.find_av_passages\` for speech, and \`stellarDocs.search_docs\` for technical text. Require exact identity or canonical slug plus source and date before attribution; otherwise say unverified or ask for context.

Evidence discipline: date volatile values with their as-of date. Copy exact symbols, types, formulas, and identifiers from results. Say "not found in these sources", not "does not exist". State visible source conflicts instead of choosing silently. Broaden vocabulary or abstain after empty entity lookups.

Host blocks preserve metadata and truncation. Read listed artifacts with \`codemode.artifact.info(id)\` / \`codemode.artifact.read(id)\`, then return a compact projection. Operation and skill ids are exact-match — never guess them; discover via \`search\` or \`codemode.search\` mid-script.`;

Every call resolves to { ok: true, data } or { ok: false, error: { kind, message, hint? } } — payload fields live under \`.data\` (\`r.data.projects\`, never \`r.projects\`); check \`r.ok\` first. Skill hits are operational playbooks — read the sections you need in-script via \`codemode.skill.read(id, { sections })\` (keys: the hit's \`availableSections\`), and pair them with stellarDocs searches for current reference truth. For a design-stage request to create a new artifact, make one prior-art pass before architecture: at most two \`scout.searchRepos\`/\`scout.searchProjects\` discovery calls, one focused detail call, and three returned candidates. Return exact URL, role/applicability, freshness/provenance, and limitations; license/audit/deployment/compatibility stay unknown unless source-backed. Skip it for a single-step how-to or debugging task. Hits whose \`signature\` shows a \`codemode.skill.run("<exact id>", input)\` line are runnable skills — call that line verbatim to run the whole pipeline in one step (payload under \`.data\`, constituent calls audited in \`data.calls\`). Hit order is the ranking to trust: gated hits rank first, and a backfill hit appears above gated hits only when its score decisively dominates them. Recovery candidates are bounded exact-ID contingencies, separate from ranking: use relevant ones in the same execute when an open-world answer remains empty, weak, adjacent, ambiguous, or partial, and validate identity/source/date before asserting. Signatures with a stubbed output type (\`{ /* N top-level fields: ... */ }\`) list the payload's top-level field names — for the full output shape call \`codemode.describe("<exact id>")\` inside \`execute\`. For directory/list rows, inspect keys or filter raw row JSON and nested/common field variants before projecting compact columns. Use \`codemode.search(...)\` mid-script for follow-up discovery; search again here with the other candidate family, varied vocabulary, or \`kind\`/\`service\` filters if none fit.${truncated ?
