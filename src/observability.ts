/**
 * Structured event logging for Workers Logs (observability.enabled in
 * wrangler.jsonc). One JSON line per event via console.log; the platform
 * groups lines by invocation, so every event of one /mcp request — auth mode,
 * tool call, each sandbox op — reads as a single correlated trace in the
 * dashboard (Workers → Logs) or `wrangler tail`.
 *
 * Discipline:
 *  - `evt` names the event; keep the rest FLAT and SMALL (counts, statuses,
 *    operation/catalog ids, and durations — never user/model content or
 *    content-derived hashes).
 *  - Never log secret values, queries, execute code, results, answers, or
 *    provider error messages. Adapter results are already secret-redacted
 *    before they reach the model-facing boundary, but redaction is not
 *    permission to log them.
 *
 * Second channel: trace spans (observability.traces in wrangler.jsonc).
 * Handler + host-side fetches are auto-instrumented; the sandbox boundary has
 * a custom span in src/executor/run.ts (Worker Loader isn't auto-traced).
 * Rule of thumb: logEvent for facts to query later (what happened), spans for
 * timing attribution (where the time went). Same no-payload discipline; spans
 * bill from the same event quota as logs (research/observability-cloudflare.md).
