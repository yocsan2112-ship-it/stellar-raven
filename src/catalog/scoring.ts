/**
 * Routing-aware scoring layer on top of the vendored lexical scorer
 * (src/catalog/vendor/search-scoring.ts — untouched upstream math).
 *
 * This module adds structural adjustments to the vendored scorer.
 * Every lever below is query-independent and applies uniformly to the whole
 * catalog. No per-question special cases, no query→service maps.
 *
 * Seven levers (numbered 1–7 below; lever 6 is query-side alias
 * canonicalization, documented at QUERY_TOKEN_ALIASES), each fixing a
 * measured, structural imbalance (eval/README.md baseline: 203
 * skill-sections lexically crowding 57 operations; 40/338 questions gated
 * to zero hits; single services flooding all top-5 slots):
 *
 *  1. Stopword GATE-RESCUE — when an entry fails the vendor scorer's
 *     token-coverage gate on the full query, it is rescored with general
 *     English stopwords (a standard Snowball-style closed-class set, NOT
 *     derived from any eval question) removed from the query. Coverage
 *     becomes a statement about content words; entries that already passed
 *     keep their exact vendor score. (Filtering stopwords for ALL scoring
 *     was tried and measurably regressed routing — matched closed-class
 *     words in prose descriptions carry real signal in the vendor math.)
 *
 *  2. Kind weighting — skill-section entries (fragments of a SKILL.md whose
 *     whole-skill entry also ranks) are scaled by 0.75. The search tool
 *     exists to route a model to something it can CALL or open whole; 203
 *     near-duplicate fragments should not blanket-outrank 57 operations on
 *     shared topical vocabulary. (Since the 2026-07-13 skills-form A/B all
 *     section entries also carry searchable:false and never enter search in
 *     the shipped catalog — this weight only applies in experiment arms that
 *     re-enable them.) Whole-skill entries keep full weight.
 *
 *  3. Service-diversity selection — the top-`limit` SET is chosen with a
 *     per-service quota (score order otherwise preserved). A routing search
 *     that shows one service five times tells the caller strictly less than
 *     one that shows the two runner-up services too. The quota only changes
 *     set membership below the flood point: the top-scoring entry is never
 *     displaced, and a service's FIRST in-page hit always survives (quotas
 *     only trim a service's third-and-later appearances).
 *
 *  4. Low-weight keyword field — skill-section entries
 *     carry build-time `keywords` distilled from the section BODY
 *     (src/catalog/extract-keywords.ts); descriptions are heading + first
 *     paragraph truncated to 200 chars, so mid-section content (error codes,
 *     flags, function names) was lexically invisible. The vendor file stays
 *     byte-identical: the entry is scored twice — once as-is, once with the
 *     keywords appended to the description — and the keyword-attributable
 *     DELTA is blended in at KEYWORD_BLEND (0.4 × description weight ≈ the
 *     vendor's own low-weight `kind` field). The rescue path re-admits
 *     gate-failed entries at KEYWORD_BLEND damping with NO structural cap:
 *     a rescued section CAN outrank a weak genuine name/description match
 *     (measured pair: rescued 35 vs genuine 17). The routing eval (legacy
 *     gates + skills lane, eval/run-routing.mjs) is the guard against that
 *     trade going bad; changing the blend requires re-running it.
 *
 *  5. Ungated scoring path for tiered gate-rescue backfill — the
 *     vendor coverage gate (search-scoring.ts:130, <60% token coverage and
 *     no exact phrase → null) is structurally unreachable for long
 *     multi-clause questions: at 20+ query tokens NO single entry covers 60%
 *     of the vocabulary, so the whole catalog gates to zero. The stopword
 *     rescue (lever 1) does not help — the surplus tokens are content words.
 *     `scoreEntryWeightedUngated` is the same pipeline (keyword blend,
 *     stopword rescue, kind weight) over a gate-free replica of the vendor
 *     math, kept beside it the same way lever 4 double-scores rather than
 *     editing the vendor file. searchCatalogPage() (searchCatalog's engine)
 *     uses it ONLY to backfill a result page the gated tier left short. A
 *     backfill hit ranks above a gated hit only when its ungated score is >=
 *     TIER_INTERLEAVE_MARGIN times the gated hit's score. The drift guard in
 *     test/scoring.test.ts proves the two scorers share a scale wherever the
 *     gate passes (see search.ts).
 *
 *  7. Routing-keyword field (Scout 1.7.16 x-routing) —
 *     operation entries may carry `routingKeywords`: vocabulary the upstream
 *     service curates specifically for routing and publishes separately from
 *     its prose description (Scout's `x-routing` extension: purpose, useWhen,
 *     exampleQuestions, keywords). Same double-scoring shape as lever 4 but
 *     blended at ROUTING_KEYWORD_BLEND — hotter than schema-shrapnel
 *     keywords, cooler than the description itself — per upstream's own
 *     consumer convention ("score as separately-weighted fields rather than
 *     concatenating into the description"). Chosen by A/B sweep at the
 *     1.7.16 absorb; the routing eval guards changes. (Lever 6, query-side
 *     alias canonicalization, is documented at QUERY_TOKEN_ALIASES below.)

 *  2. Coverage-gate semantics (thresholds, exactPhrase escape) — the gate is
 *     the one line deliberately absent here; if its meaning changes, re-check
 *     search.ts's tier-2 rationale, not just this file.
 *  3. Returned search shape upstream ({ results, total, truncated }) — ours
 *     mirrors it in searchCatalogPage; keep parity.
 *  4. Newly exported search helpers — prefer composing with upstream over
 *     maintaining this copy if searchConnectors becomes importable.
 *  5. Type-gen changes (vendor/json-schema-types.ts) affecting
 *     renderSignature and the 5d compaction wrapper.
 *  6. Any native docs/snippet/section weighting upstream grows — may
 *     supersede our kind-weight lever 2.
