/**
 * Catalog types — the unified, machine-generated index that `search` ranks
 * (PLAN §2 as a starting sketch, deliberately trimmed).
 *
 * One entry per callable surface: every service operation, every skill, and
 * every skill section. `scripts/build-catalog.mjs` generates
 * `catalog/manifest.json`; `loadManifest` (src/catalog/search.ts) validates it
 * against `catalogSchema` before anything trusts it.
 *
 * Field rationale (what earns its place for a two-tool search+execute MCP):
 *  - id / service / kind / description → the search scorer's input fields.
 *  - inputSchema / outputSchema        → rendered into the TS `signature`
 *    returned with operation and runnable-skill hits, and execute-side arg
 *    validation — the model never owns URLs/args, PLAN §4.
 *  - transport                         → what the adapters need to actually
 *    place the call.
 *  - provenance                        → where the entry came from + snapshot
 *    time, so drift is attributable to an inventory refresh.
 *
 * Deliberately absent:
 *  - policy/auth/cost — exposure is filtered at BUILD time (ADR-0003): the
 *    manifest is the exposed surface, so every entry in it is callable or
 *    readable and a runtime allow/deny layer has nothing to express.
 *    Exclusions (paid ops, write endpoints, retired skills, upstream skill
 *    twins) live as data + reasons in scripts/build-catalog.mjs.
 *  - raven-next's `resultShape` (evidence/soft-empty/error paths): search
 *    never reads it, and execute-phase normalizers are per-service code, not
 *    per-entry data. Likewise the stellarDocs corpus taxonomy: it lives in
 *    specs/stellar-docs.json and ships to the model inside the super spec.
