/**
 * Skill-availability canary — the only detector for a Cloudflare-side failure
 * of the serve-don't-store path.
 *
 * WHY IT CANNOT LIVE IN CI. Skill bodies are fetched from
 * `raw.githubusercontent.com` at request time. The daily `check-mirrors --fetch`
 * proves those pins resolve *from a GitHub Actions runner* — which says nothing
 * about whether the deployed Worker can reach them. Egress blocking, a
 * shared-IP rate limit, or a runtime regression can break serving while every
 * external check stays green. So the check runs from inside the Worker: no
 * inbound request, no auth surface, no secret.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE. Cron Triggers run wherever Cloudflare has spare
 * capacity, not across the colos serving user requests — so this samples ONE
 * execution location per run. It catches global and shared-infrastructure
 * failures, which is the realistic case; it cannot rule out a fault confined to
 * some other colo. Real-traffic `skill_read outcome:error` remains the only signal
 * that covers user-selected colos, and neither replaces the other.
 *
 * WHY IT BYPASSES THE CACHES. Pinned URLs are cached `immutable` for a year and
 * memoized per isolate. A canary on the normal read path would answer from a
 * warm colo entry and report "healthy" for months after egress died. It builds
 * its own source with `bypassCaches` for exactly this reason, and that source
 * neither reads nor writes the shared memo, so probing cannot alter what real
 * traffic sees.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It does not alert, retry-until-green, or gate anything.
 * It writes a verdict; `refresh.yml` reads it through `/health/skills` and
 * classifies it. Keeping the judgement out of the Worker means a flaky probe
 * cannot page anyone on its own.
