/**
 * runSkill — the host dispatch behind `codemode.skill.run`.
 * This pure module has no cloudflare:workers import. Providers wire it into
 * the sandbox, and unit tests exercise it directly.
 *
 * Resolution ladder — every rung an envelope, nothing throws toward the
 * caller: (1) name must be a non-empty string; (2) exact catalog id lookup,
 * miss names the full runnable set and the store's nearest-id suggestion
 * (never a resolution); (3) an existing-but-not-runnable entry points at
 * skill.read; (4) input validates via the same guard/validateArgs path
 * operations use — model code never owns the contract; (5) registry lookup
 * (belt: unreachable once assertRunnersWired runs at provider build);
 * (6) execute with a recording sub-facade under a host deadline.
 *
 * The host owns the audit trail (research/skill-run-design.md §6). Each
 * declared operation's facade function is
 * wrapped to append { op, ok, errorKind?, ms } to a ledger this module owns.
 * `calls` on the output, the error path's `error.details`, and the
 * `skill_run` event counts all come from that ledger — a buggy runner can
 * project a section wrongly, but it cannot make a failed call disappear from
 * the report or corroborate its own lie (its own `calls` key is overwritten
 * unconditionally).
 *
 * Deadline: Promise.race against RUNNER_DEADLINE_MS returns a timeout error
 * envelope on expiry. NOT cancellation — in-flight facade calls continue
 * detached until the request context ends (harmless: free read-only ops,
 * each still logging its own `op` event).
 *
 * Output-schema warn belt: after attaching `calls`, the full data payload is
 * validated against the runner's outputSchema — a mismatch logs
 * outputSchemaOk: false but does NOT fail the run (a defensive projection
 * half-handling upstream drift must surface in telemetry, not ship silently
 * under the advertised type). Ordering note: the design sketch lists the belt
 * before the calls attach; validating AFTER lets the belt check the exact
 * bytes the model receives, including the host-attached `calls` the schema
 * declares.
