/**
 * Claude 5 reasoning, sent explicitly instead of inheriting the server default.
 *
 * NEVER `thinking: { type: "disabled" }`, even for effort "none". Anthropic's
 * own guidance is that "where adaptive thinking is available, effort is the
 * recommended way to control thinking depth", and disabled thinking is the
 * restricted path: Opus 5 hard-400s on it at xhigh/max, which
 * `@ai-sdk/anthropic` knows (`rejectsThinkingDisabledAboveHighEffort: true` for
 * opus-5) but does NOT know for fable-5 or sonnet-5 — both are grouped with a
 * `false`, so the SDK would happily send a request Fable rejects. Adaptive plus
 * a low effort is the sanctioned way to buy latency, and it collapses every
 * model to one path.
 *
 * This is also why the unified `streamText({ reasoning })` field is unusable
 * here: it maps "none" straight to `thinking: { type: "disabled" }` for EVERY
 * model, with no per-model guard.
 *
 * `adaptive` is a thinking MODE, never an effort value — the two are separate
 * fields and Anthropic calls out the confusion explicitly. `effort` accepts
 * low|medium|high|xhigh|max only, so "none" and "minimal" both floor to "low".
 *
 * Unmatched Claude ids (haiku, 4.x) fall through to `{}` and the server
 * default on purpose: 5-family config 400s on older models, and the model
 * override accepts arbitrary slugs.

 * `transport` picks the DISPATCH, and the two dispatches have different Unified

 * `transport: "gateway"` uses provider-native PASSTHROUGH, which deliberately
 * strips `x-api-key`/`authorization`. Passthrough's Unified Billing list is
 * narrower than the run catalog: Sonnet 5 and Opus 5 are on it, Fable 5 and
 * Gemini are not — so those two were forwarded to api.anthropic.com and
 * generativelanguage.googleapis.com with NO credential, and the PROVIDER
 * answered `x-api-key header is required` / `Method doesn't allow unregistered
 * callers`. Provider errors, not gateway errors, which is what made it read as
 * a billing problem.
 *
 * Omitting `transport` selects `"run"` -> `binding.run(slug, body, { gateway })`,
 * the Unified Billing path. The gateway is NOT dropped: the rate limit and the
 * account spend rule still apply, and extraHeaders (`cf-aig-collect-log-payload`,
 * `x-session-affinity`) are still forwarded. What passthrough uniquely offers —
 * response caching, server-side fallback, BYOK aliases — this demo never uses,
 * and chat.ts runs its own client-side fallback loop.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow: openai/* and xai/* stay on passthrough because both are
 * green today and Responses-mode over the run path is unverified. Do not widen
 * this without probing the models it would move.
