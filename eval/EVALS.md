# Eval map — what we measure and why

This server is two tools — `search` and `execute` — for AI agents working the Stellar
ecosystem. Every eval here exists to answer one question at some layer:

> **Does an agent driving this MCP end-to-end produce a correct, current, non-fabricated
> answer?**

That end-to-end number (the QA eval) is the **headline**. Everything else is a cheaper or
sharper instrument pointed at one layer of it. When two evals disagree, the one closer to
the headline wins.

## The instruments

| Instrument | Layer | Cost / when to run | Headline vs diagnostic |
|---|---|---|---|
| `eval/run-routing.mjs` — legacy 338 strict | `search` ranking, offline | free, seconds — **every scoring/catalog change** | **GATE**: committed absolute baseline with a ±1% band. The authoritative input fingerprints, accepted totals, timestamp, and decision note live in `eval/gates.json`; `--gate` exits 1 on breach and CI runs it on every push/PR. Historical movements are recorded in `eval/README.md`. |
| — skills lane (23, hand-authored) | skills routing | free, same run | **GATE**: must not fall below the current top-1 floor in `eval/gates.json`; top-3/top-5/card@5 remain visible diagnostics. |
| — extended lane (122, real-user phrasing) | `search` on jitsu-mined questions | free, same run | Diagnostic; **target metric for retrieval work**. Read the latest local result for the current tree. Local results are not committed and do not define the gate baseline. |
| — protocol-history v1 lane (8 positives, 4 controls) | `search` routing to a cited research corpus | free, same run | Historical frozen diagnostic inside `run-routing.mjs`. Positives require `scout.searchResearch` in the top five. Controls forbid any top-five capture. |
| `npm run eval:protocol-history` — v2 original plus blind sets (19 required, 9 forbidden, 4 neutral) | protocol-history routing and symmetric false captures | free, seconds — every candidate for this work | Source-epoch-bound frozen diagnostic. The runner checks source hashes before scoring. It writes `source-expired` without scored sets after any mismatch. Eligible results stamp the actual manifest and contract digests. |
| — accept-either views (corpus `acceptable_cards` ∪ overlay) | label-tolerance context | free, same run | Diagnostic only; never the headline |
| `eval/discovery/` | one-search, agent-allowed-≤3-search, and mined-query replay source-family / usable-route discovery | one-shot/replay free; agent arm paid; after discovery guidance or retrieval-shape work | Diagnostic: 43 adjudicated cases; `familyHit@3` + `usableOp@5`; paired miss classification; 91-query LumenLoop replay lane |
| `eval/agentic/` | agent-driven `search`, live server | ~$, minutes — after major search-behavior changes | Diagnostic (label-ambiguity analysis) |
| `eval/qa/run-qa.mjs` — main battery (501) | **end-to-end search → execute → answer** | ~$0.2–0.7/case, ~30 min per 30-case sample — before/after big changes, A/Bs | **HEADLINE** (correct / partial / wrong) |
| `npm run eval:playground` — actual `/playground/chat` SSE over existing QA cases | public playground model loop → tools → answer | paid; seeded 5-case default, max 30 per run-scoped subject — after playground prompt/model/loop changes; model-backed runs require an operator-matched server/tree generation and machine-readable round-cap context | Diagnostic, scored by the same QA judge/evidence pack; v2 artifacts self-pin answering/judge/cap/source provenance; never merge its denominator with the main MCP headline |
| — canonical live-data contract `live-data-canonical-v3` (`--cases eval/qa/corpus/live/live-cases.json`, 15 = the carried v2 ten (7 Scout / 2 Lumenloop / 1 cant-do, byte-identical under an independent projection digest) + 5 behavioral additions: lifecycle-label provenance, jobs recency, cross-service reconciliation, guessed-slug soft-empty, artifact-read continuation) | `execute` **grounding** where priors fail | ~$3.30–10 full at the documented ~$0.22–0.67/case — after executor/adapter changes | Diagnostic for the execute path; membership/order stays the frozen 15 while full case content is pinned by the contract's `caseContentDigest`; graded on behavior, never exact values. History: `live-data-canonical-v2` (10 cases) was the contract through 2026-07-12 and saturated at 10/10; v2 aggregates stay v2-denominated, per-id comparison remains valid for the carried ten |
| — opt-in digest contract `live-digest-supplement-v2` (`--cases eval/qa/corpus/live/live-digest-supplement-cases.json`, 2 Lumenloop) | `execute` recency-digest grounding | ~$0.44–1.34 full at the same per-case estimate — only for digest/skill-run questions | Diagnostic supplement; report separately from the canonical live-data lane and main battery |
| `eval/plan/grade-plan.mjs` | which services `execute` actually touched | free (regrades stored QA transcripts) | Diagnostic (coverage; progression informational only) |

`npm run eval:qa:paired` is an experimental stored-run printer. It requires 100 eligible IDs
after exclusions, so it does not apply to the sample-30 headline lane.

Corpus provenance: the QA battery is **owned** at `eval/qa/corpus/battery/` (one hand-authored
file per case; `eval/qa/README.md`); `eval/corpus/` is the **archival** vendored snapshot and
the routing eval's committed label source (`eval/corpus/PROVENANCE.md`) — the raven sibling
repos are retired; growth happens in this repo's own formats.

**Owned-battery and sample history.** The current battery has **501 active cases as of 2026-09-17**.
The 500→501 compile added `q-tw-escrow-api-auth-custody`.
Use the generated registry and selected case IDs to establish each run's denominator.
The 499→500 compile added `q-scf-resolve-passport-superseded-slug`. The 497→499
compile added two `scout.hackathonBrief` cases to the 497-case corpus. The retrieval audit
previously added five service-semantics cases to the 492-case corpus. Commit
`6e1f979` before that added two Soroban cases to the 490-case corpus. The 490-case corpus was created
after six release-closeout cases were added to the 484-case 2026-07-11 baseline. Historical
484-case, 490-case, and 492-case results retain their original denominators. Per-id comparisons
remain valid when the rubric and pack tuple matches.

The sample-30 algorithm did not change: it allocates proportionally by `tags.service`, sorts each
stratum by id, and makes even-spaced picks. Growing the Scout and LumenLoop strata by three cases
each changed those pick positions, so recompilation deterministically retained 25 ids and replaced
five. Removed: `q-defi-liquid-staking-whitespace`, `q-hist-quantum-preparedness-plan`,
`q-scf-current-hackathons-compare-live`, `q-scf-rfps-hackathons-live`, and
`q-ti-explain-repo-payload-status`. Added: `q-defi-defindex-honest`,
`q-hist-meridian-2026-corrected-venue`, `q-scf-current-round`, `q-scf-sdf-bug-bounty`, and
`q-ti-openzeppelin-relayer`. None of the six new cases itself entered sample-30. Therefore, that
historical sample was deterministic for the 490-case corpus but was **not membership-identical**
to the 2026-07-11 484-case baseline sample. Aggregate before/after claims across that boundary
require either the same explicit ids or a disclosed sample-membership change.

The 492→497 compile retained 9 sample ids and replaced 21. Two new cases entered sample-30.
`eval/qa/README.md` records the exact membership history. Comparisons across this boundary need a
common-id set or a disclosed membership change. The 497→499 compile retained 28 sample ids and
replaced two. The 499→500 boundary also needs a common-id set or a disclosed membership change.

## Rules that keep this from getting messy

1. **One headline, two gates, everything else is diagnostic.** New reporting views don't
   get promoted into gates without a decision recorded in the round ledger. The two gates are
   mechanical, not prose: baselines live in `eval/gates.json`, every `run-routing` run
   prints a gate verdict, `--gate` turns a breach into exit 1, and CI runs
   `eval:selftest` + `eval:routing -- --gate` on every push/PR — so re-baselining means
   changing `gates.json` in the same commit as the change that moved the numbers. The file
   records SHA-256 fingerprints for every gated data input and exact accepted lane totals.
   Grading-rule changes
   re-baseline the gates explicitly (results files carry `gradingRule`). Current rule: v3,
   manifest-exposed entries only, no lumenloop/skills twin identity; cross-service tolerance
   belongs in `expected_any`, not in the strict headline.
2. **Lanes never merge.** The legacy 338, skills 23 (active; +8 documented-inert
   `retiredCases` in `eval/skills-cases.json` after the 2026-07-03 onboarding-skills
   retirement, ADR-0002), extended 122, protocol-history v1 diagnostic 12, v2 diagnostics 12 and 20,
   membership-frozen canonical live-data 15
   (`live-data-canonical-v3`; the carried v2 ten are a subset of it, and v2-denominated
   aggregates stay v2-denominated), and opt-in live-digest
   supplement 2 are separate scopes with separate denominators, forever. A historical
   12-case run means canonical v2 + supplement were run together; it is not a canonical-lane
   result. Comparability > bigger n.
3. **No per-question tuning.** Zero-hit cases stay failing until a *general* mechanism
   fixes them (inherited from the raven ADRs; it has held through three scoring rounds).
4. **Spirit, not schema.** Corpus content is fair input; foreign schemas, judge code, and
   labels built for other systems are not. Concretely: the semantic battery's `skillsAny`
   labels were evaluated and **deliberately not imported** (2026-07-03) — they were
   diagnostic-only in their source system, use cf-flue composite skill names, and every
   skill family they reference is already covered by the 23 active hand-authored skills cases
   (`eval/skills-cases.json`; 8 onboarding-skill cases moved to inert `retiredCases` on
   2026-07-03 per ADR-0002).
   Adding them would have grown the denominator, not the signal.
5. **Freshness-sensitive truth is graded as behavior, not values.** Anything that drifts
   (RFPs, leaderboards, rounds, region vocab) belongs in the live-data lane with a
   behavioral golden; putting a snapshot value in a hard gate is how evals rot.
6. **Hand-authored files are the sources; compiles can't wipe them.** The owned QA battery
   (`qa/corpus/battery/**`), the routing supplements (`skills-cases.json`,
   `build-question-overlay.json`), and the frozen live contracts
   (`qa/corpus/live/live-cases.json`, `qa/corpus/live/live-digest-supplement-cases.json`) are
   committed. `eval:selftest` pins both named QA contracts' names, ordered membership, and
   case-content digests. Any live-contract question/golden/tag/note change requires an explicit
   contract-version bump, provenance note, and digest update. Generated files
   (`routing-cases.json`, `qa/cases.json`, `qa/sample.json`, `qa/lifecycle-registry.json`) are never hand-edited — CI
   byte-pins them.
7. **Results are local-only evidence** (`eval/**/results/`, gitignored). Routing results stamp the actual manifest SHA-256. `eval/gates.json`
   carries the routing gate's committed fingerprints and accepted totals. READMEs carry historical
   records and can cite exact local result stamps. A routing gate can add `evidence.localTrace` as
   optional context, but the trace is never required to resolve the baseline. The results dirs are
   unbounded. Prune results older than 30 days after the active investigation ends.
8. **Discovery is intentionally narrower than QA.** Its one-shot lane asks whether one verbatim
   `search` surfaces an expected family in the top 3 and a usable operation/skill in the top 5.
   The agent arm allows a real caller at most three searches and records visible hits plus final
   selection; the replay lane uses PII-safe queries mined from eval agents, never raw user traffic.
   Paired classification separates retrieval, agent-behavior, and downstream rows. None of these
   lanes measures final-answer correctness; use QA for that headline.
9. **Agentic cross-service tolerance needs an explicit contract change.** The current agentic
   workflow grades the exact expected service. Before the next comparable run, either consume the
   committed per-case `expected_any` labels and stamp that grading contract, or keep exact-primary
   grading. Never reinterpret stored results after the run.
10. **As-of-date omissions need a cross-shard inventory.** The 2026-08-14 row review found several
    otherwise-correct answers that omitted dates for volatile claims. Inventory the pattern across
    service shards before changing prompts or rubrics. A single case remains diagnostic and does
    not justify per-question tuning.
11. **Remote service identity is part of QA comparability.** A stable listener only proves the
    local process identity. It does not prove the Scout, Lumenloop, or Stellar Docs identity.
    A comparable live collection requires one pinned public probe and one pinned pre-arm vector.
    It also requires matching captures around every answering call and one matching postflight.
    A successful attempted postflight must record `skippedReason: null`.
    A missing baseline is a separate guard failure, not a probe failure.
    Any missing capture, probe failure, or changed vector makes the artifact non-comparable.
    The runner suppresses all aggregates after such a failure.
12. **Concurrent paired collection has one supervisor.** Use
    `npm run eval:qa:paired:collect -- --plan <plan.json> --authorized-plan-sha256 <sha256>`.
    The plan uses `qa-paired-collection-plan-v2`. The supplied hash must equal the canonical plan
    hash. Keep the owner authorization outside the plan. The owner signature covers the canonical
    hash and every command array in the plan. The plan freezes exactly 200 selected IDs and exactly
    500 unique active corpus IDs. It binds both ordered ID hashes, selected content, cases bytes,
    commands, four worktrees, and input hashes. Each cases path stays inside its runner. Both runners
    must reproduce every corpus field. The executing supervisor and control module must match their pins.
    Baseline and candidate use different revisions and surface hashes. Baseline uses `add-missing`;
    candidate uses `verify-native`. Their public and upstream ports are pairwise distinct.
    Shared measurement flags match. Both servers reproduce one salted `.dev.vars` identity without
    recording values. Keep this salted plan uncommitted, then delete it after the run.
    The plan binds the free capacity command, instrument, artifact, schedule, thresholds, and
    24-hour freshness window. The exact 86,400,000 ms boundary is valid. The artifact must prove
    two overlapping captures and 14 successful
    responses. It must show no errors, retries, or `Retry-After`. Vectors must match, and real request
    concurrency must occur. The `--stable-sha256` remote probe still controls immediate service drift.
    The plan also binds the exact P6 wrapper command and its seven `$0.50` calls.
    P6 refuses an existing output or temporary output. It never overwrites a method record.
    The plan binds both directed flip re-judge commands and requires `--allow-empty`.
    Each flip command pins the Claude path, binary SHA-256, and environment SHA-256.
    The re-judge checks these identities before and after judging. It stamps them in the artifact.
    The supervisor enforces row barriers, alternating monotonic release order, shared cancellation,
    child exits, a bounded termination drain, and a four-hour deadline. Wall-clock times provide
    duration evidence only. Before the receipt, each artifact must exist in its arm results
    directory. It must be comparable and match the selected IDs and exact content identity.
    Its server revision must match that arm's frozen `--server-revision`.
    Collection uses `$80` per arm. Stored judging raises the same ledger to `$120` per arm.
    A failed collection produces no paired aggregate or receipt. See `qa/README.md` for the full
    plan and receipt contract.

## Primary artifact: service-improvement recommendations

This server's own tuning ceiling is limited — scoring tweaks buy single-digit points. The
outsized leverage of running these instruments is **discovering gaps and errors in the four
upstream surfaces** (Lumenloop, Stellar Light/Scout, Stellar Docs, skills). So a primary
artifact of every eval run is an evidence-backed set of service-improvement recommendations
filed in `improvements/` (charter: `improvements/README.md`; one file per finding, in the
matching collection: `lumenloop/`, `stellar-light-scout/`, `stellar-docs/`, `skills/`).

- **Filing rule:** every eval round files new findings or updates existing ones. A round
  that surfaces an upstream gap and doesn't file it has dropped its most valuable output.
- **Evidence rule:** findings move `proposed → verified → reported-upstream → fixed-upstream`;
  `verified` requires live re-execution evidence, not a stale transcript.
- **Scope rule:** `improvements/` is for the upstream services only. Fixes to this repo's
  own scoring/catalog/executor go to `.agents/TODO.md`, as ever.

## What we deliberately do NOT measure

- **General-web questions** (perplexity/parallel arms) — this server intentionally has no
  web arm; 51 corpus cases skipped with reasons, 10 curated none-traps kept.
- **Raven-agent internals** (its brand, its Airtable, its pipeline stages) — 4 traps
  skipped; stage-attribution grading dropped.
- **Weighted rubric scores / citation hard-gates** — replaced by coarse
  correct/partial/wrong + explicit missingFacts/wrongClaims (robust to judge variance;
  rationale in `research/audits/2026-07-qa-history.md`).
- **Exact placements/rankings from surfaces that don't carry them** — the upstream reviews
  rejected those cases (`sl-hackathon-kale-reflector-1st`, `sl-hackathon-kale-vs-blend-counts`,
  `sl-ecosystem-asset-rwa-underbuilt-unfunded`); the rejections hold here and the live-data
  lane encodes their failure modes as `avoid` items instead.
