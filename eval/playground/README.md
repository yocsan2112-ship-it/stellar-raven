# Playground semantic evaluation

`scripts/run-demo-model-gauntlet.mjs` remains the eight-case transport and tool-loop smoke test. It checks that models can complete the SSE chat path cleanly; it does not establish factual answer quality. It prints the validated matrix first and will not create artifacts, read `.dev.vars`, mint cookies, or start Wrangler unless the operator explicitly supplies `--confirm-paid` (for example: `node scripts/run-demo-model-gauntlet.mjs --models openai/gpt-5.4 --confirm-paid`). The printed total is planned Playground chat turns, not guaranteed provider calls.

`npm run eval:playground` is the complementary semantic lane. It sends existing QA cases to the real `POST /playground/chat` SSE route, captures the final assistant text, search/execute outcomes, terminal reason, latency, HTTP/SSE errors, and grades the final answer with the existing `eval/qa` golden, evidence-pack, and judge contract. It introduces no new quality rubric and does not change corpus or golden content.

Use a pane already running `npm run dev` and its bound loopback URL; do not start Wrangler for this command.

```sh
# Free validation: default seeded, stratified five-case selection; no HTTP/model/judge calls.
npm run eval:playground -- --dry-run

# Free route-auth validation: signed run cookie reaches body validation before throttle/model work.
npm run eval:playground -- --preflight

# Print the source-tree generation after the reviewed tree is frozen.
npm run eval:playground -- --print-generation

# Small paid run. Both provenance assertions are mandatory before model spend.
npm run eval:playground -- --confirm-paid --url http://localhost:8787 \
  --server-generation <sha256-from-print-generation> \
  --round-cap-context /tmp/playground-round-cap.json \
  --sample 5 --seed baseline-a

# Targeted reproduction.
npm run eval:playground -- --confirm-paid \
  --server-generation <sha256-from-print-generation> \
  --round-cap-context /tmp/playground-round-cap.json \
  --ids q-aas-burn-clawback-redemption-mechanics

# Whole named contract, only when it stays within the one-subject 30/hour cap.
npm run eval:playground -- --confirm-paid \
  --server-generation <sha256-from-print-generation> \
  --round-cap-context /tmp/playground-round-cap.json \
  --cases eval/qa/corpus/live/live-cases.json --full
```

`--server-generation` is deliberately an operator assertion, not runtime introspection. The
harness requires it, checks it against the complete local working-tree generation before the
first model call, checks that the tree stayed unchanged before writing, and records the limit
honestly: this does not prove that an already-running Worker loaded those bytes. The reviewed
operator must ensure the reused `dev` pane represents that generation. A generation is
machine-local, not a portable build or deployment identity; the value only attests to the named
operator's local tree at the harness checkpoints.

`--round-cap-context` is a JSON `playground-semantic-round-cap/v1` input. A reviewed round uses
non-negative integer ceilings and consumption counters; the harness refuses before spend when
the selected answer/judge calls would exceed an absolute cap:

```json
{
  "contract": "playground-semantic-round-cap/v1",
  "experimentId": "2026-07-15-playground-round-a",
  "kind": "reviewed-round",
  "runAllocation": "planned",
  "plannedAnswerCalls": 10,
  "absoluteAnswerCallCap": 12,
  "answerCallsConsumedBeforeRun": 0,
  "plannedJudgeCalls": 10,
  "absoluteJudgeCallCap": 12,
  "judgeCallsConsumedBeforeRun": 0,
  "infraRetryReserve": 2,
  "infraRetryConsumedBeforeRun": 0,
  "savedAnswerRejudgeReserve": 3,
  "savedAnswerRejudgesConsumedBeforeRun": 0
}
```

Do not copy those example numbers into a real run: encode the independently reviewed round's
actual authorization and current consumption. Set `runAllocation` to `planned` for ordinary calls
or `infra-retry` for a transcript-proven retry; the latter is bounded by the remaining retry
reserve. A one-off unreviewed diagnostic must instead use `kind: "not-applicable"`, a non-empty
`reason`, `runAllocation: null`, and all ten numeric cap fields present as explicit `null`; such an
artifact is labeled diagnostic and is not evidence for a reviewed eval-round conclusion.

The cap context is an operator-maintained cumulative ledger, not a shared transactional counter:
the named round owner updates `*ConsumedBeforeRun` between invocations and verifies the next
projection before spending. The harness fail-closes an inconsistent or over-cap input, but cannot
account for model calls made outside the supplied machine-local context.

`--no-judge` captures a route/trace diagnostic only; omit it for the semantic result. Results are timestamped JSON below `eval/local-lanes/playground-semantic/`, which is gitignored. Newly produced files use metadata contract `playground-semantic-result/v2` and input snapshot `playground-semantic-input/v1`. They pin the ordered configured primary/fallback models, effective/requested API mode, reasoning effort, answering temperature, explicit judge model/rubric/pack/unpinned-temperature semantics, demo/evaluator/round caps, local tree generation, and raw corpus/manifest/super-spec plus evaluator-source hashes. The answering block also records that the route does not expose actual attempted models in SSE; configured fallback is pinned, fallback activation is not claimed. Internal hashes are revalidated by the re-judge reader; omission or mismatch fails. Historical artifacts remain untouched.

If a required local generation checkpoint observes a mismatch after an answer call has started, or the checkpoint itself fails after spend, the invocation fails closed (exit 1) without writing a normal result. It instead makes a best-effort local-only `playground-semantic-quarantine/v1` file at `<out-dir>/quarantine/<runId>-playground-semantic-quarantine.json`. A quarantine has `quarantinedMeta` and `quarantinedRows`, never normal top-level `meta`, `rows`, or `summary`; it is non-promotable and may be used only for spend reconciliation and runner forensics. It cannot support factual, upstream, eval, causal, scoring, re-judge, aggregate, or comparison claims. A quarantined transcript may motivate an investigation, but any finding needs fresh non-quarantined evidence from a clean rerun or recurrence probe.

Quarantined spend still increments the operator ledger's `*ConsumedBeforeRun` counters by the saved started-call minimums. Exit 1 with a quarantine file means update the ledger from its `spend` block; exit 1 without one means reconstruct the conservative counts from the stderr marker. `infraRetryAuthorized: false` is not a retry authorization: any retry needs a new reviewed cap context. The harness checks before each answer, after each answer before any judge, and before normal finalization; it does not prove the bytes loaded by an already-running Worker or continuously observe edit/revert cycles.

Their saved transcript uses `mcp__playground__search` / `mcp__playground__execute` aliases with full JSON-stringified inputs and results, so the existing plan grader works directly:

```sh
npm run eval:plan -- eval/local-lanes/playground-semantic/<stamp>-playground-semantic.json
```

Run that regrade after playground prompt or tool-loop changes. Treat this as a separate playground lane: do not merge its denominator or scores with the main MCP QA battery.

For live loopback runs, the harness reads `MCP_SERVER_SECRET` from the environment or `.dev.vars` without logging it and mints an ephemeral run-scoped demo cookie. This exercises the normal cookie-authenticated per-subject throttle while avoiding collisions in the shared `dev-loopback` bucket; it never uses this cookie against a non-loopback URL.

One run-scoped subject is intentionally limited to the real `DEMO_CAPS.chatsPerHour` ceiling (currently 30). Selection over that cap, including `--full` against the main battery, is rejected before the harness mints a cookie or sends a request. Use `--sample 30`, a <=30-case named contract, or an explicit `--ids` shard; it never rotates subjects to evade the safeguard.
