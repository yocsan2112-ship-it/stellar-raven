 *                   in EXECUTE source. It is not a runtime call count and it
 *                   bounds one in NEITHER direction: a site inside a loop
 *                   undercounts (one occurrence, many calls), and a site inside

 *                   Read it as text that was written, never as work that ran.
 * - `readExecutes` — executes whose source contains at least one read call site,
 *                   partitioned by outcome (see READ_EXECUTE_OUTCOMES).
 * - `readOutcomes` — execute-level evidence for an ok:true read, an observed
 *                   denial, or an indeterminate result. Only the VISIBLE result
 *                   body counts: promise resolution proves nothing (a read
 *                   returns `{ ok: false }` instead of rejecting) and neither
 *                   does anything written in the source (see the rule at the
 *                   `readOutcomes.successful` branch below).
 * - `finalProjection` — the state of the LAST such execute.
 *
 * ALL of it is execute-scoped — call sites, read outcomes, and handle discovery
 * alike. `handlesObserved` counts handles this run was actually issued, which
 * only an execute result can carry.
 *
 * Everything comes from what the MODEL saw. Host-side byte counts are separate
 * evidence, so `readBytes` stays null rather than being estimated.
