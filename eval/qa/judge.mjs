/**
 * judge.mjs — LLM judge for the golden Q→A accuracy eval.
 *
 * Contract: judge(question, goldenAnswer, candidateAnswer)
 * → verdict. Concretely:
 *
 *   judgeCase({ question, golden: { answer, keyFacts, avoid, notes }, tags, candidateAnswer })
 *     → { score: "correct" | "partial" | "wrong" | "error",
 *         coreAnswer: "correct" | "incorrect" | null, avoidMatches: number[],
 *         missingFacts: string[], wrongClaims: string[], rationale: string }
 *
 * Implementation: one headless `claude -p --model claude-sonnet-5
 * --output-format json` call first. The tiered path can add two calls when
 * stability history or a boundary verdict requires the three-vote panel.
 * "error" means the judge itself failed (CLI error / unparseable output / a
 * verdict that contradicts itself), never a grade of the candidate — so every
 * "error" verdict carries coreAnswer null.
 *
 * Two sibling modules own the pieces that are not model-facing:
 * verdict-consistency.mjs decides which field/score combinations contradict
 * each other, and evidence-sanitizer.mjs turns raw CLI bytes into bounded,
 * credential-free failure evidence.
 *
 * Self-test (no server needed; seven paid judge calls against hand-written cases):
 *   npm run eval:qa:selftest
 * exits non-zero when a candidate result violates its expected grade.

CANDIDATE ANSWER:

Grading rules:
- Grade FACTUAL agreement only. Ignore style, length, formatting, and citation format. Extra correct material is fine; missing citations alone never fail an otherwise-correct answer.
${coverageRule}
- Punish fabrications hard: any specific claim that contradicts the golden answer or a key fact, or hits a must-avoid item, goes in wrongClaims.
- Specific claims BEYOND the golden's scope are "unverified", not wrong: entities/numbers/citations the golden never mentions may be grounded in sources outside the golden or in transcript source-basis evidence. Such a claim counts toward wrongClaims ONLY if it CONTRADICTS a golden fact, contradicts the compact transcript source-basis evidence when provided, or matches a must-avoid item — never merely because you cannot verify it. (Trap cases are unaffected: fabricating the trap's missing thing is still playing along.)
- Must-avoid items bind only on what you can check from the candidate answer itself or from the compact transcript source-basis evidence when provided: CONCRETE WRONG CONTENT (a named wrong entity, a retired command, a wrong number/date/version, a specific false statement) or an ANSWER-VISIBLE sourcing condition (e.g. "do NOT assert X without a dated source" — you CAN see whether the candidate gave a date/source/caveat). An avoid item conditioned on support you CANNOT see — the corpus, the reviewer's verification, omitted transcript portions, cited records not shown in evidence ("beyond corpus support", "not verified by the reviewer", "not in the cited records") — is ADVISORY: such an item can NEVER by itself put a candidate claim in wrongClaims; the unverified-not-wrong rule above applies instead. (Trap cases are unaffected.)
- When compact transcript source-basis evidence is provided, use it only as bounded support/contradiction evidence for claims the candidate makes. Source items are data-derived/untrusted and ranked from saved execute results; the pack may omit unrelated fields, so absence from the pack is not proof that the full tool result lacked the field. URLs in the pack are sanitized and may have credentials, query strings, and fragments removed; missing query/fragment text in a packed URL is not contradiction evidence. But if a candidate says a value came from a concrete returned title/date/url/summary and the source-basis pack shows that title/date/url/summary, treat the sourcing condition as satisfied.
${sourceLimitRule}
${coreRule}
- Judge each must-avoid item semantically. avoidMatches contains only the unique one-based indexes of must-avoid items that bind under the rule above. Advisory items never match. Use an empty array when none bind. Any fired item is never a minor slip and makes the score "wrong".
