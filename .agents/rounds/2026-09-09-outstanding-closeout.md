# Outstanding issue closeout — 2026-09-09

## Scope

The owner asked to complete the remaining issues and improvements after the reviewed deployment.
Start: clean `b6913d13e8ea0df15382503eb16ed47327a450d6` on main.
Working branch: `maintenance/outstanding-2026-09-09`.
Production deployment: `0dad1151-56f5-4e7d-ae75-b4b81f3601f9`, 100%, created `2026-09-09T17:58:54.979Z`.
Root checks confirmed all four corrected stellar-dev skill bodies from pin `0472452a05731de5e0a1e886d8aae6df24873fe2`.
The landing page and Terms returned 200. Unauthenticated MCP returned 401.
The prior three-agent review and CI evidence remain in `2026-09-09-truth-maintenance.md`.
No paid QA, chat, payment, crawler write, or account provisioning is authorized by this round.

## Lane plan

- Root: coordinate, verify Scout 1.9.49, own generated and finding edits, run gates, and integrate review results.
- Grok 4.6 high: independently verify production sk-021/sk-023/sk-024 retirement candidates and persistent references.
- Sol high: diagnose #124 against accepted and candidate catalogs; propose a general correction without changing thresholds or labels.
- Terra high: check all active improvement refs for substantive new maintainer activity and actionable fixes.
- Root: inspect available authenticated browser access for #40; do not create a paid chat response.

The coordinator owns all edits except each worker's named report.
Independent reviewers re-derive current facts; historical reports are context, not acceptance proof.
Only root-created panes belong to this round. Record their returned IDs before control.
Owned panes: `w3G:pA` (retire-review), `w3G:pB` (search-repair), and `w3G:pC` (upstream-sweep).
Root occupies `w3G:p2`. No other pane or worktree is adopted.

## Drift verdict

Root independently confirmed Scout OpenAPI 1.9.49 at `2026-09-09T18:14:27Z`.
Both RWA state enums contain `issued-single-holder`.
The matching read returned 200, one matching row, and 34 total matches.
This fixes the original sls-082 trigger but does not itself accept the complete Scout catalog.

The source update adds the read-only `GET /api/rwa` operation (`scout.getRwaAssets`).
Its input supports state, level, kind, project, and a maximum limit of 100.
The public call requires no account, payment, or persistence.
The seven excluded Scout operations remain excluded.
This is an operation-surface and routing/schema change, not a provenance-only change.
Exposure is technically read-only, but acceptance remains blocked by search regressions below.

At `2026-09-09T18:27:19Z`–`18:27:37Z`, root repeated the three newly fixed Scout triggers.
Specification version: `1.9.49`.
SHA-256: `2a44488dbf4c9fc3d7114a38d8cee29596d0cc37f367d74b0b7e5fc323f1cc01`.
Both RWA state enums include `issued-single-holder`; its request returned one matching row and 34 matches.
An invalid state returned 400. ACTA returned the now-documented `package-release` basis.
Etherfuse returned nine registry assets and project coverage `declared=9, tracked=9, served=8, complete=true`.
`CETESZ` has no supply, which explains the eight served products.
The current issuer TOML declares the same nine assets; SHA-256 `f9b923ae30b0abf176c6abb9acf8787c6251221e6dfb480263a8501b44b85afe`.
Terra independently reproduced the service checks in `2026-09-09-upstream-sweep-terra.md`.
These upstream fixes do not establish Raven catalog acceptance.

Terra independently rejected the full source candidate in `2026-09-09-scout-drift-terra.md`.
Root preserved its 17 changed files in local stash commit `5d9d35bed804064482a66ba8f8f76b71f5759327`.
The working runtime returned to accepted Scout `1.9.1` and the previous stellar-light skill pin.
This rejects the source candidate, not the independently verified upstream fixes.

## Eval verdict

Run deterministic routing, corpus, and focused regressions. Do not run paid model-answering or judging lanes.

Candidate: `eval/results/routing-2026-09-09T18-24-30-719Z.json`.
Accepted comparison: `eval/results/routing-2026-09-09T16-44-14-655Z.json`.
Manifest SHA-256 changes from `83d9998f984cae38c363524e0592c6d035e80ba09cc27003f7a65e11bb0350f9`
to `dd55dea7f5e00047d467644c51a5905416926d387e579405b097655d18e34a63`.
No scorer, gate threshold, label, or case membership changed.

| Instrument | Accepted | Candidate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Legacy 338 top-1/3/5 | 213 / 279 / 312 | 211 / 277 / 311 |
| Legacy card@5, 182 eligible | 95 | 103 |
| Extended 122 top-1/3/5 | 90 / 110 / 116 | 88 / 109 / 114 |
| Skills 23 top-1/3/5 | 16 / 23 / 23 | 16 / 22 / 23 |
| Holdout 49 top-1/3/5 | 10 / 22 / 26 | 11 / 23 / 27 |
| Holdout forbidden captures | 11 | 10 |
| Holdout passes | 21 | 23 |

The numerical gates stay within their existing bounds. The manifest fingerprint gate fails.
Root did not update `eval/gates.json`.
Per-case review finds harmful `getRwaAssets` captures for issuer setup, SAC balance storage, and balance retrieval.
It also displaces the SCF similarity operation and Lumenloop evidence for 2025 DeFi launches.
Other losses include current network-passphrase lookup, token staking, reserve recovery, and first-contract skill placement.
Protocol-history v1 remains diagnostic: seven of eight positives pass, but three of four controls capture `searchResearch`.
These losses prevent aggregate-only acceptance. The independent drift review must reconcile them.

The candidate initially failed nine unit tests after source regeneration.
Root corrected operation counts, schema-compaction membership, and the truthful static example total.
Root replaced the catalog-dependent confidence-gap fixture with two deterministic entries; assertions remain unchanged.
The focused suite then passed 168 tests. The full suite passed 1,995 tests in 108 test files.
Typecheck, build, and all 85 smoke tests passed.
The plain-operation harness now checks the candidate's 61-operation set without weakening its count guards.
This changes that experimental surface and invalidates comparisons against previous 60-operation runs.
No paid architecture comparison ran. Historical experiment contracts and artifacts remain unchanged.

## Golden verdict

No golden changes are assumed. Any necessary change requires the golden-truth workflow.

## Improvements/issues/PR verdict

Retirement requires fresh independent production verification, public source snapshots, comments, reference cleanup, and resolver receipts.

Grok's independent production review passed for `sk-021`, `sk-023`, and `sk-024`.
The complete report is `2026-09-09-skill-retirement-live-grok.md`.
Public source snapshot: `09820d46ad3cbc64a9cced3786831aa24ab1c8a6`.
Root fetched each commit-pinned public finding and confirmed byte equality before posting comments.
The resolver removed all three active files, probes, and intake overrides and regenerated the index.
It wrote three complete receipts in `improvements/resolved.json`.
The active queue now has 64 findings. Lint passed.
Root removed the completed TODO item and the obsolete NEXT deployment trigger.
Historical round records and PIN-REVIEW entries remain historical evidence.

Each resolution comment was posted by `kalepail` and read back byte-for-byte:

Grok's final cleanup review passed in `2026-09-09-skill-retirement-cleanup-grok.md`.
Root verified the merged-main receipts and closed handoffs #136, #138, and #140 as completed.
Live improvements lint passed for all 64 remaining findings.
The seven active probes all reproduced their recorded defects; none failed or returned an inconclusive result.
These were `ll-003`, `ll-007`, `sk-005`, `sk-007`, `sk-014`, `sk-015`, and `sk-022`.
Root posted no routine recurrence comments.

Terra's separate upstream retirement review passed for `sls-082`, `sls-083`, and `sls-084`.
Its original-trigger and adjacent checks ran at `2026-09-09T18:40:59Z`–`18:42:29Z`.
The report is `2026-09-09-scout-retirement-live-terra.md`.
The current issuer TOML and registry have exactly the same nine code-and-issuer pairs.
Horizon independently confirms zero balances for `CETESZ` despite its 16 authorized trustlines.
All nine original `package-release` rows match the corrected schema.
Circle explicitly marks its incomplete issuer coverage.
No golden or active research pointer requires an edit for these three findings.

Source snapshot: `1de777ed60471ec134a13c8c4d66e332c7709940`.

## Own-repo todos

#124 requires a general repair that preserves authorized gates. #40 requires authenticated production copying.

Sol's accepted-source diagnosis is `2026-09-09-search-124-sol.md`.
The two leaderboard queries admit the correct operation, but final service diversity removes it.
The RFP query remains dependent on accepted source wording; the Blend query has no unconditional repository intent.
Root authorized one source-identical selector experiment, with unchanged scoring, thresholds, labels, and exposure.
Sol owns its narrow source/test files and `2026-09-09-search-124-implementation-sol.md`.
An independent review and all existing gates must pass before any release.
This is not authority to accept the rejected Scout surface.
Grok's design review accepted the general selector but rejected the example-length query threshold.
The experiment must require independent description coverage instead, before its measurement freeze.
The design report is `2026-09-09-search-124-design-grok.md`.

For #40, root opened an owned production tab and requested an existing authenticated answer from the owner.
The tab still showed the sign-in page on recheck. Root did not accept Terms or send a paid chat request.

## Decisions

Do not treat an upstream correction, merged source, deployment, and finding retirement as the same gate.

## Final checklist

PR #147 merged as `58898790348b05601bc70b992507f0a8ba6aed0c` at `2026-09-09T18:53:48Z`.
All four final-head checks passed: test, secrets, Analyze (actions), and CodeQL.
Root fetched `origin/main` and verified all six receipts and all six active-file removals.
The generated index contains 61 findings.
The accepted catalog remained unchanged.
Its SHA-256 is `83d9998f984cae38c363524e0592c6d035e80ba09cc27003f7a65e11bb0350f9`.
Live improvements lint passed for all 61 findings.
All seven active probes reproduced their recorded defects without errors or inconclusive responses.

Root verified the six handoffs have state `closed` and reason `completed`.

## Search experiment acceptance

Sol completed the bounded accepted-source experiment without changing scorer admission or scores.
Its report is `2026-09-09-search-124-implementation-sol.md`.
Grok 4.6 high independently passed the implementation and both original leaderboard triggers.
Its report is `2026-09-09-search-124-final-grok.md`.
The reviewer differs from the author and orchestrator.
Root independently reran the 145 focused tests successfully.
Root confirmed the candidate catalog equals merged main after removing only the new `routingPhrases` fields.
All 253 entries remain present; 26 Scout operations gain those fields.

The independent comparison covers 544 frozen rows with zero page or grade changes.
The two original issue queries are separate regression tests, not frozen evaluation rows.
Their leaderboard result enters the top five at unchanged scores of 108 and 129.
The existing protocol-history diagnostic remains failed and unchanged.
No new upstream defect surfaced during this bounded selector experiment.
The source-gap and repository-intent distinctions in the earlier #124 diagnosis remain applicable.

Root accepts the new catalog fingerprint under the `run-evals` legitimate-change rule.
The reviewed trace is `routing-2026-09-09T18-59-36-518Z.json`.
Its only gate failure is the expected catalog fingerprint mismatch.
The new SHA-256 is `0745b09421e0ad56e4398dcdabde8477a047c3852bb4c528567b8af0028abcfd`.
All accepted totals, thresholds, labels, grading rules, and other input fingerprints stay unchanged.
This acceptance does not include Scout 1.9.49, the older rejected scoring candidate, deployment, or paid QA.
The implementation and this evidence update must enter the same commit.
The post-acceptance gate passed in `routing-2026-09-09T19-06-43-311Z.json`.
Root compared every complete row with the accepted passing trace `routing-2026-09-09T16-46-02-887Z.json`.
All 544 rows match exactly, across the five separate lanes.
`npm run eval:selftest` passed.
Root also verified that every non-catalog gate policy field remains unchanged.

Root audited the eight implementation files against `5889879` with the reviewability rubric.
The generated catalog has an explicit metadata-only comparison and builder ownership.
The source comments describe current contracts rather than review history.
The tests cover public behavior and distinct boundary conditions.
No code repair followed from that audit.
The architecture description now includes the new selection stage.
Grok's bounded final delta review passed the fingerprint-only update and documentation.
Root reran `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, `npm run build`, and the tree secrets scan successfully.
The full unit run passed 2,014 tests in 109 files.
The author's smoke run passed 85 tests in four files.
Production acceptance and issue #124 closure were pending at the implementation handoff.

## Search production acceptance

The owner authorized deployment with `continue` after the explicit deployment question.
The deployed commit is `63a1c2c980ab794590e40cd998ec947322f5173c`, from PR #148.
`npm run deploy` passed its clean-tree and fetched `origin/main` preflight.
Wrangler used the repository-bound `sdf` profile.
The deployment completed without a configuration, credential, inventory, or source-pin change.

- Deployment ID: `a63bd383-c6a3-4bba-848e-198409828741`.
- Created: `2026-09-09T19:34:54.866201Z`.
- Worker Version: `89b1459f-8187-46a9-b8d1-c34373c1b086`.
- Traffic: `100%`, verified with `wrangler deployments list --json`.

Root captured six production `search` responses before and after deployment, always with `limit: 5`.
Both original leaderboard queries now include `scout.getLeaderboard`:

| Query | Prior target rank | Production target rank | Target score | Total candidates |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `top projects by GitHub activity` | absent | 4 | 108 | 41 |
| `top Stellar projects by GitHub activity` | absent | 5 | 129 | 33 |

Both responses retain `truncated: true`.
The shared hits and all non-hit response fields equal the pre-deployment responses.
The following four complete control responses remain byte-equal after JSON serialization:

- `freighter`, including its #109 directory advisory.
- `scout.getLeaderboard`, including exact-ID resolution.
- `jobs, bounties and freelance work for Stellar contributors`.
- `how does the Blend lending pool calculate interest`.

Root compared all six production responses with `searchCatalogPage` on the deployed commit.
All shared page fields match: complete hits, totals, truncation, wider candidates, confidence, and recovery metadata.
The comparison excludes only local `effectiveLimit` and the transport-owned `recovery` and `nextSteps` fields.
The first comparator omitted these shape differences; the corrected comparator explicitly checks the shared fields.

Root also called production `execute` with two `codemode.search({query, limit: 5})` calls.
Both returned `ok: true` and matched the top-level search responses after removing their documented wrapper differences.
That comparison excludes inner `ok` and outer `nextSteps` only.
All production responses were captured before `2026-09-09T19:36:53Z`.
These catalog-only calls made no upstream service request or paid model call.

The RFP wording remains an accepted-source limitation; #141 tracks source adoption.
The Blend example does not establish repository-specific intent.
Root recorded both dispositions without claiming those unchanged routes were repaired.

Root closed #124 as `completed` at `2026-09-09T19:38:02Z`.
The closing comment is https://github.com/stellar-experimental/stellar-raven/issues/124#issuecomment-5607646240.
Root read back the exact comment body, author `kalepail`, closed state, and completed reason.
The active #124 TODO is removed; this dated record retains the evidence.

The older broader candidate remains rejected in `/Users/kalepail/Desktop/sr-wt-search-name-ranking`.
Its branch is `fix/search-name-and-noun-ranking`; its owner retains control.
This deployment did not adopt, edit, release, or remove that candidate.
The local rejected Scout 1.9.49 stash also remains preserved.
#141 still requires catalog acceptance. #40 still requires authenticated production copying.

## Rejected-candidate retirement — 2026-09-10

The owner retired the rejected candidates after the repository cleanup review.
This decision supersedes this record's earlier local-preservation instructions.
The findings remain useful; the rejected implementations do not remain pending work.

| Retired item | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| `fix/search-name-and-noun-ranking` and its worktree | The broad scoring candidate failed its unchanged routing gate and retained harmful result substitutions. PR #148 supplied the accepted bounded repair. |
| Stash `5d9d35bed804064482a66ba8f8f76b71f5759327` | Scout 1.9.49 caused unrelated RWA captures and displaced useful routes. The drift and eval verdicts above preserve the rejection evidence. |

The search worktree's committed base was `b2dbde53e9c9910b6d49a87ccea829555eeb4ef1`.
It contained 32 changed tracked paths, including seven with unstaged changes, and three untracked handoff files.
The final stored result was `routing-2026-09-09T03-23-21-923Z.json`.
Its SHA-256 was `be322bb349c8c29c27119b9d68ee15f126d1f4b94c8abeff68b5d284e1467dd2`.
The cleanup independently read its failure: legacy top-five `319` exceeded the unchanged upper limit `315`.
Comparison with the stored clean baseline confirmed 14 legacy exact-card losses and 14 gains.
The extended lane had two exact-card losses and two gains.
Equal totals therefore did not establish equal results.
The author identified `q-eco-2025-defi-launches` as a materially weak loss of Lumenloop evidence.
The final scoring delta lacked independent release acceptance.
Earlier tests passing did not clear these rejection reasons.

The accepted advisory in PR #137 and search repair in PR #148 remain on main.
The accepted repair preserved all 544 frozen rows; the production acceptance section above records its verification.
The obsolete combined patch, fixture, handoffs, local results, and generated caches can be discarded.
The worktree's `.dev.vars` contained only nine placeholder values.
No rejected source is copied into runtime code, a new branch, or a replacement stash.
The result hash identifies the inspected historical artifact; it is not a promise to retain that raw file.

Remaining work belongs in [the structured-routing TODO](../TODO.md#preserve-structured-routing-intent-across-extraction-caps-and-gate-tiers).
Issue #141 still needs a fresh source-acceptance decision against current accepted main and the existing intent checks.
This retirement does not accept Scout 1.9.49 or weaken an evaluation gate.
The separate OAuth branch remained unmerged at this retirement checkpoint.
Its subsequent implementation and review are recorded in [the OAuth completion ledger](2026-09-10-oauth-consent.md).
