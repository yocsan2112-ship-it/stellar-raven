Scope: free and read-only review. No paid call ran.

## Verdict

**CORRECTIONS REQUIRED**

Keep the Scout 1.9.30 reject decision.
Do not ship this generated surface or change `eval/gates.json`.

The commit correctly restores the accepted generated files.
Its hashes and reported headline routing values are reproducible.
Its protocol-history result also expires before scoring.

However, the active-findings section materially misstates live deployment data.
It checks the absent plural `deployments` field.
It does not report the populated singular `deployment` object.

The report also understates direct schema changes by one operation.
It omits material movement in the extended and skills routing lanes.

## Exact required corrections

### 1. Replace the active-findings introduction

Replace the no-resolution statement with this text:

> The live schema partially improves deployment qualifiers.
> It does not resolve the recorded product-level and per-network evidence gaps.
> The singular `deployment` object differs from the absent plural `deployments` field.

### 2. Replace the `sls-023` statement

Use these facts:

- The RWA query returned 61 rows.
- All 61 rows included a singular `deployment` object.
- Fourteen objects reported `mainnet` with `onchain-activity`.
- Forty-seven objects reported `unknown` with a null basis.
- No row included a plural `deployments` key.
- One row had a nonempty `products` array.
- DTCC supplied that announced product record.
- DTCC remained `Development` with an operator-announcement source.
- DTCC's singular deployment remained `unknown`.

Do not say that DTCC has "no deployment."
Say that Scout has no verified DTCC deployment.
Also record its announced H1 2027 product separately.

This is a partial upstream fix for `sls-023`.
It does not resolve product identity, source coverage, or deployment verification.

### 3. Replace the `sls-024` statement

Slender, Laina, K2 Lend, and OrbitCDP each returned a singular deployment object.
Each object reported `network: "unknown"` with a null basis.
Each project had a null `products` value.
K2 Lend also retained a null `supportedNetworks` value.

Do not describe these rows as having zero deployments.
That wording hides the singular object and its explicit unknown state.
The `sls-024` deployment-scope residual still reproduces.

### 4. Replace the `sls-029` statement

The four oracle rows omitted `oracleDeployments` and plural `deployments`.
They returned these singular deployment values:

| Project | Network | Basis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Band | `mainnet` | `onchain-activity` |
| DIA | `testnet` | `human-verified` |
| Redstone Finance | `mainnet` | `human-verified` |
| Lightecho | `mainnet` | `onchain-activity` |

Lightecho retained one product record.
The other three rows had null products.

This is a partial project-level improvement.
It does not provide the requested per-product oracle contract and feed evidence.
The `sls-029` residual therefore remains open.

### 5. Clarify the `sls-033` statement

The exact wallet query returned 71 rows.
Sixty-two rows had a non-null `productKind`.
Thirty-three rows had a nonempty `availability` value.

All 71 rows included `canonicalSlug`.
All 71 values were null.
Use "no row had a non-null `canonicalSlug` value."

MXlet retained null `productKind`, `availability`, and `canonicalSlug` values.
Its singular deployment object reported `unknown`.
The `sls-033` residual still reproduces.

### 6. Correct the direct-schema count

The 1.9.1 to 1.9.30 comparison has 22 direct parameter or response-schema changes.
The Terra report states 21.

The other classification counts are correct:

- 36 paths and 37 upstream operations in each source;
- no added, removed, or renamed operation;
- 27 changed full operation objects;
- 15 changed `x-routing` blocks; and
- six changed shared schemas.

### 7. Add the omitted routing movements

The reported legacy Scout and overall percentages are correct.
The report must also show these diagnostic movements:

| Lane | Accepted 1.9.1 | Candidate 1.9.30 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Legacy Scout top-1/top-3/top-5 | 52.6/84.2/94.7 | 53.7/87.4/95.8 |
| Legacy overall top-1/top-3/top-5 | 63.0/82.5/92.3 | 62.7/82.5/92.3 |
| Extended overall top-1/top-3/top-5 | 73.8/90.2/95.1 | 73.8/89.3/93.4 |
| Skills top-1/top-3/top-5 | 69.6/100.0/100.0 | 69.6/95.7/100.0 |
| Holdout overall top-1/top-3/top-5 | 20.4/44.9/53.1 | 22.4/46.9/55.1 |

Holdout forbidden captures changed from 11 to 10.
The candidate met the configured numeric floors.
The gate failed because the candidate manifest lacks an accepted fingerprint.

State that distinction directly.
A fingerprint mismatch proves a source change.
It does not independently prove a numeric routing regression.

### 8. Keep the reject decision, but correct its basis

The reject decision remains correct for this review.
The candidate is mixed routing and response-contract drift.
It is not a mechanical catalog bump.

The full routing movement lacks an accepted intent decision.
The source-epoch-bound v2 diagnostic is unavailable.
The live deployment response also needs a correct impact reconciliation.

These limits block a safe baseline change now.
The absent plural `deployments` field does not support the rejection.

## Independent hash verification

The accepted file hashes match the report:

| File or source | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- |
| Accepted `inventory/stellar-light.json` | `1a261c4a2e2172683e91a52ddc33b02ff41e74760c861dfacb29c60a8d8671b0` |
| Accepted sorted OpenAPI | `cce1091864cd41dee739f6b7b590b3c0a10b25b6bab76b9b69175f01efd753d4` |
| Retained 1.9.23 inventory | `1bfe9d6ada6518d834a3893bb9df039ed77e1a16499897af6bdcbed878c0fc4f` |
| Retained 1.9.23 sorted OpenAPI | `662a54f11b0ed1b027722d74fdc92b960cf5a7d7e975cc1fb1c273031a8d2320` |
| Current accepted manifest | `b613201846076e9fbaa70edfee4f506841c7cf690265e69c8d07afde567f6729` |

I reconstructed the report's exact 1.9.30 inventory timestamp in an isolated temporary copy.
Its inventory hash was `0cbc081a11c3bf27000952cf97cf8cc03b1429d59dd05834cde5ad628b144d45`.
Its generated manifest hash was `b942dbab5cf5aa624cd8e461f0c1dbe08d279e43d51b926f51fece6aa48451a9`.

The current live OpenAPI still reports version 1.9.30.
It has 36 paths and 37 operations.
Its sorted OpenAPI hash is `2acc43c45eab21156a61d242c0d35b82ec7f9894854a01a88426e310b0311571`.

## Accepted-file restoration

Commit `3fed7cf` changes only the Terra report.
The five generated files match parent commit `898063e` byte-for-byte.

The checked files were:

- `inventory/stellar-light.json`;
- `catalog/manifest.json`;
- `src/mcp/micro-map.ts`;
- `specs/super-spec.json`; and
- `eval/plan/op-classes.json`.

The accepted inventory remains Scout 1.9.1.
The accepted manifest contains 30 exposed Scout operations.
All seven existing Scout exclusions remain unchanged.
No Scout operation intersects the bundled Lumenloop runner.

## Protocol-history expiry

Both v2 contracts expect this frozen manifest hash:

`4cd28f4bdfe8c73950e0a6d4dfa1a09dd2f82674859e93990fdd62daef24fe8b`

The restored accepted manifest has this different hash:

`b613201846076e9fbaa70edfee4f506841c7cf690265e69c8d07afde567f6729`

The target scoring and routing hashes still match their frozen values.
Only `manifest-sha256` caused expiry.

The evaluator returned `measurementStatus: "source-expired"` for both contracts.
It emitted no scored sets.
No protocol-history question was scored.

Keep the source epoch strict.
Do not repin it for Scout 1.9.30 in this change.

## Free gate results

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run eval:selftest` | PASS |
| `npm run eval:compile` | PASS, 338 legacy and 122 extended cases |
| `npm run eval:routing -- --gate` | PASS on restored accepted files |
| `npm run eval:protocol-history` | Expected exit 1, both contracts source-expired |
| `npm run improvements:lint` | PASS, 70 findings |

The isolated candidate rerun reproduced the reported manifest fingerprint failure.
It also reproduced the candidate routing values shown above.

## Final disposition

Return the generated Scout files to no change.
Keep the accepted Scout 1.9.1 surface.
Correct the Terra report before using it as the final drift record.

**CORRECTIONS REQUIRED**

## Re-review of commit `cf29cc9`

Date: 2026-09-04

**PASS**

Commit `cf29cc9ed0ea3296fbc2d805246f882a737fee35` satisfies all eight corrections.

1. The findings introduction states the partial fix and distinguishes `deployment` from `deployments`.
2. The `sls-023` statement includes the 61-row deployment counts and the DTCC product state.
3. The `sls-024` statement includes each singular unknown deployment and the remaining scope gaps.
4. The `sls-029` statement includes each singular deployment and the remaining product-level evidence gap.
5. The `sls-033` statement includes the exact counts, null `canonicalSlug` values, and MXlet state.
6. The direct parameter or response-schema count is 22.
7. The report includes every required routing lane and explains the fingerprint failure correctly.
8. The report keeps the reject decision and uses mixed contract drift as its basis.

The commit changes only `scout-1.9.30-drift-terra.md`.
The accepted generated artifacts remain byte-identical to commit `898063e`.

| Accepted artifact | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- |
| `inventory/stellar-light.json` | `1a261c4a2e2172683e91a52ddc33b02ff41e74760c861dfacb29c60a8d8671b0` |

The standards review found no repository-rule violation.
The specification review found no missing correction or scope expansion.
