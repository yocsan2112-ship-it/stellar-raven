# Verified intake readiness — 2026-09-04

## Scope

I audited the eight active `verified` findings at root commit
`898063e2fd417b83388e5b179ac72d722bc14de1`.
The recurrence commit `bd7330b` also marks `ll-030` and `sd-046` as `verified`.
I included both findings in the worktree readiness check.

I made no root-worktree change.
I made no upstream filing or comment.

## Intake repair

I added deterministic finding overrides for these missing mappings:

| Finding | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| `sk-021` | `stellar/stellar-dev-skill` |
| `sd-049` | `stellar/stellar-docs` |

The root branch already maps `sd-050`, `sd-051`, `sk-023`, and `sk-024`.
I preserved those mappings and their root reasons exactly.

`ll-030` resolves through the Lumenloop service rule.
Its owner is `lumenloop/lumenloop-backend`.
It needs no finding override.

## Filing readiness

Every listed finding passed `npm run improvements:file -- --file <file> --dry-run`.
The dry runs did not post an issue.

| Finding | Owner | Intake source | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sk-021` | `stellar/stellar-dev-skill` | finding override | ready |
| `sk-022` | `OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-skills` | finding override | ready |
| `sk-023` | `stellar/stellar-dev-skill` | finding override | ready |
| `sk-024` | `stellar/stellar-dev-skill` | finding override | ready |
| `ll-030` | `lumenloop/lumenloop-backend` | service lumenloop | ready |
| `sd-046` | `stellar/stellar-docs` | finding override | ready |
| `sd-049` | `stellar/stellar-docs` | finding override | ready |
| `sd-050` | `stellar/stellar-docs` | finding override | ready |
| `sd-051` | `stellar/stellar-docs` | finding override | ready |
| `sd-052` | `stellar/stellar-cli` | finding override | ready |

## Gates

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run improvements:index` | Passed. 70 findings. |
| `npm run improvements:lint` | Passed. 70 findings. |
| `npm run improvements:lint -- --live` | Passed with network access. |
| `ll-030` filing dry run | Passed. The service rule selected `lumenloop/lumenloop-backend`. |
| All ten filing dry runs | Passed. |
| `./node_modules/.bin/vitest run test/improvements-*.test.ts test/improvements-writes.test.mjs` | Passed. Five files and 41 tests. |
| `npm run secrets:scan -- --tree` | Passed. No leaks found. |

## Blockers

No intake blocker remains.
Filing still requires separate user authorization and normal upstream deduplication.
