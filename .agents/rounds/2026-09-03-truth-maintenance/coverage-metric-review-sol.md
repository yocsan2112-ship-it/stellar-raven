# Coverage metric independent review

## Final re-review verdict

**PASS**

Reviewed repair commit: `a21fd5b11815357a6ae435a8418ccbbba2fe7203`.

Reviewer: Sol high.

The repair resolves R1 and R2. I found no remaining required finding.

### R1 verification

`writeState` now deletes both keys from `RETIRED_MEASUREMENT_METRIC_KEYS` before every write.
The deletion shares the same path as current metric cleanup.
It covers normal judging, zero-call finalization, interrupted judging, and suppressed aggregates.

I repeated the zero-call reproduction with the named 500-row artifact.
The path made zero judge calls and stamped `meta.judgeStored`.
Neither retired key remained. All five current fields remained.

The stored tests seed both retired keys in three write states.
They assert removal after zero-call finalization, a suppressed write, and an interrupted write.
The suppressed test also asserts that all five current fields remain absent.

### R2 verification

The README now names `2026-09-04T05-40-51-variantA` as an affected artifact.
It now describes artifacts produced before the repair instead of using the incorrect date cutoff.
It also explains stored rewrites and unchanged historical bytes.

The paired test comment uses the same repair boundary and names the affected artifact.

### Re-review commands

```text
cp /private/tmp/stellar-raven-tm-runner/eval/qa/results/2026-09-04T05-40-51-variantA.json .review-stored-artifact.json
node --input-type=module -e 'import { readFileSync } from "node:fs"; import { judgeStoredResults, prepareJudgeStabilityRegister } from "./eval/qa/run-qa.mjs"; const file = ".review-stored-artifact.json"; const stabilityRegister = prepareJudgeStabilityRegister({ pinnedPath: "/private/tmp/stellar-raven-tm-paired-stability.json", log: () => {} }); let judgeCalls = 0; const result = await judgeStoredResults(file, { judgeModel: "claude-sonnet-5", judgePanel: 1, stabilityRegister, judge: async () => { judgeCalls += 1; throw new Error("unexpected paid judge path"); }, log: () => {} }); const written = JSON.parse(readFileSync(file, "utf8")); console.log(JSON.stringify({ judgedCount: result.judgedCount, judgeCalls, judgeStoredStamped: Boolean(written.meta.judgeStored), retiredPresent: ["meanContinuousCoverage","continuousCoverageRowCount"].filter((key) => Object.hasOwn(written.meta,key)), currentMetricKeys: ["halfCreditShare","strictCorrectShare","coreAnswerCorrectShare","gradedCoreAnswerNullCount","coreAnswerVerdictCount"].filter((key) => Object.hasOwn(written.meta,key)) }, null, 2));'
rm .review-stored-artifact.json
```

Result: `judgedCount: 0`, `judgeCalls: 0`, and `retiredPresent: []`.
All five current metric keys remained.

```text
npx vitest run test/qa-measure-harness.test.mjs test/qa-judge-stored.test.mjs test/qa-paired-verdict.test.mjs test/qa-harness-preconditions.test.mjs
```

Result: 4 files passed. All 193 tests passed.

```text
npm run typecheck
```

Result: exit 0.

```text
npm run eval:qa:paired:validate
```

Result: exit 0 with `"pass": true`.

```text
git diff --check
git diff a21fd5b^ a21fd5b --check
```

Result: both commands returned exit 0.

```text
npm run secrets:scan -- --tree
```

Result: exit 0. The repository secret scan and `gitleaks` found no leak.

### Remaining risks

- Untouched historical artifacts keep the invalid fields. Current readers ignore them.
- A stored rewrite changes metadata bytes. `sourceResultsSha256` preserves the original collection identity.
- Both paid arms must use one final runner revision and one QA implementation hash.

Blockers: none.

No paid call ran. I changed only this review report.

## Initial review record

The record below covers `d1fddb9f32ce77532d719a1ab9c6254378ad023f`.
Its `CHANGES-REQUIRED` verdict does not apply to `a21fd5b11815357a6ae435a8418ccbbba2fe7203`.

## Initial verdict

**CHANGES-REQUIRED**

Reviewer: Sol high.

Reviewed commit: `d1fddb9f32ce77532d719a1ab9c6254378ad023f`.

Parent commit: `80aaf52d81c032a44bbd844e9d1f6e6c94aab12b`.

Branch: `codex/tm-coverage-metric`.

I reviewed the implementation diff before I read the author report. I made no paid calls.

## Initial required findings

### R1. The stored-judge rewrite keeps both retired fields

`judgeStoredResults` removes only the five keys returned by the new `qaMeasurementMetrics` function.
It does not remove `meanContinuousCoverage` or `continuousCoverageRowCount` from existing metadata.

I copied the named artifact and ran the stored-judge finalization path. The injected judge throws on any call.
The path made zero judge calls and stamped `meta.judgeStored`.
It kept `meanContinuousCoverage: 0.5601952380952382` and `continuousCoverageRowCount: 500`.
It also added all five replacement fields.

This result creates a newly written artifact with both metric contracts. The invalid numeric value remains easy to quote.
The author report describes only a null and zero residual from an old `--no-judge` artifact.
The same path also preserves the named artifact's invalid numeric value.

Required repair:

- Delete both retired keys in `writeState` before each stored-judge write.
- Add a stored fixture that starts with both retired keys.
- Assert their absence after a zero-call finalization.
- Assert their absence when `aggregatesSuppressed` is true.

This repair is narrow and forward-only. It changes only artifacts that the new stored-judge code rewrites.
Untouched historical artifacts keep their original bytes and remain readable.

### R2. The retirement date text excludes the named defective artifact

`eval/qa/README.md` says records dated before `2026-09-04` can show the retired value.
The named defective artifact is dated `2026-09-04T05-40-51`.
The comment in `test/qa-paired-verdict.test.mjs` uses the same date boundary.

Required repair:

- Describe artifacts produced before this repair, not artifacts dated before `2026-09-04`.
- Name the affected `2026-09-04` arm when useful.

## Defect reproduction

Artifact:
`/private/tmp/stellar-raven-tm-runner/eval/qa/results/2026-09-04T05-40-51-variantA.json`

SHA-256:
`e629666bf476244d350840069094a8a579757724c101830d6d6727685b5904f7`

Independent results:

| Check | Result |
| --- | ---: |
| Rows | 500 |
| Stored mean | `0.5601952380952382` |
| Recomputed mean | `0.5601952380952382` |
| Negative rows | 49 |
| Negative panel rows | 49 |
| `q-jutsu-what-is-a-memo` key facts | 2 |
| `q-jutsu-what-is-a-memo` unioned missing facts | 3 |
| `q-jutsu-what-is-a-memo` coverage | `-0.5` |
| `q-jutsu-what-is-a-memo` panel size | 3 |

The negative values are real calculation results. They are not display or rounding defects.
The panel joins prose findings, so the list is not a key-fact index.

## Repair scope assessment

Removing both fields is the narrowest truthful design repair. A clamp would hide the invalid data model.
A paraphrase matcher would add a new judge without a measured contract.
A schema union would still not map prose entries to golden facts.

The implementation removes the calculation and its `compiledCases` dependency. That part is narrow.
It keeps the five valid grade-count metrics unchanged.
It also removes the retired metric from both console paths.

The stored-judge cleanup in R1 was necessary at `d1fddb9`. No wider metric redesign was necessary.

## Caller and compatibility review

I traced every `qaMeasurementMetrics` caller.

| Area | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Collection aggregate | Uses only judged active rows. It stamps only the five current fields. |
| Stored-judge write | Computes the five current fields. It fails to delete the two retired fields. |
| Stored-judge return | Returns only the five current fields. |
| Collection return | Returns only the five current fields. |
| Stored-judge console | Prints only the five current fields. |
| Collection console | Prints only the five current fields. |

The paired tuple does not include either retired field. The paired compatibility test passed with asymmetric old keys.
The stored result schema remains `qa-agent-result-v4`.
That schema protects the row failure and usage shape, not optional aggregate metadata.
No repository JSON schema promises either retired field.

The following readers ignore both retired fields:

- `eval/qa/paired-verdict.mjs`
- `eval/qa/compare-architecture-ab.mjs`
- `eval/qa/re-judge.mjs`
- `eval/qa/judge-stability.mjs`
- `eval/qa/combine-ab-shards.mjs`

Historical artifacts remain valid JSON. Current readers use rows, identity metadata, costs, or explicit tuple fields.
I found no hidden repository consumer for either retired field.

The dated research records can keep the old values as history. The current README correctly marks those values invalid.
R2 must repair the incorrect date boundary.

## Test assessment

The new metric tests cover negative values, panel unions, repeated paraphrases, overcounting, and empty rows.
They also cover the five replacement metrics and the console line.

The paired test covers old-key compatibility. The stored-judge test covers a new artifact without old keys.
It does not use a fixture that already contains the retired keys. That omission permits R1.

## Risks

- An external unversioned consumer can depend on the retired keys. The repository has no such schema promise.
- Old artifacts keep invalid values. Readers must not compare or quote those values.
- The stored-judge in-place rewrite changes metadata. Its original source hash preserves the prior artifact identity.
- The QA implementation hash changes with this repair. Both paid arms must use the same final runner revision.

## Blockers

None.
