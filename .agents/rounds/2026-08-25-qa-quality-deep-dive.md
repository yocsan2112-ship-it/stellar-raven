# QA quality deep dive — 2026-08-25

## Scope

Diagnose why the headline QA score sits near 65% (half-credit basis) and produce an
evidence-backed improvement plan. Five max-effort lanes fan out under Herdr; the
orchestrator synthesizes into two research documents.

## Evidence base

- Latest full battery run: `eval/qa/results/2026-08-14T03-56-23-variantA.json`
  (100 cases, answering model `claude-sonnet-5`, judge `claude-sonnet-5`, rubric
  `v2.4`, pack `p3`). Verdicts: 45 correct / 39 partial / 15 wrong / 1 error.
- Rejudge of the same run: `eval/qa/results/2026-08-18T22-04-13-rejudge.json`:
  40 / 46 / 14. Judge flip rate between passes: 17/100 (7 up, 10 down).
- Half-credit score: ~63–64.5% — the "~65%" under review.

## Lanes

| lane | agent (model, effort) | report |
| --- | --- | --- |
| golden-truth legitimacy + judge audit | Claude Fable (`fable`, effort max) | `research/qa-deep-dive-2026-08-25/fable-max.md` |
| pipeline failure forensics | Codex (`gpt-5.6-sol`, max) | `research/qa-deep-dive-2026-08-25/sol-max.md` |
| assumption attack + alternatives | Grok (`grok-4.6`, xhigh) | `research/qa-deep-dive-2026-08-25/grok-xhigh.md` |
| service coverage gap map | Codex (`gpt-5.6-terra`, max) | `research/qa-deep-dive-2026-08-25/terra-max.md` |
| SOTA survey + fresh-eyes spot audit | OpenCode (`moonshotai/kimi-k3`) | `research/qa-deep-dive-2026-08-25/kimi-k3.md` |

All lanes read-only against the repository except their own report file.

## Ledger

- `2026-08-25T21:40Z` — round opened; evidence base compiled from existing results;
  no new eval runs started yet.
- `2026-08-25T21:52Z` — five panes split from `w3:p13`; agents started: fable-max
  (Claude `fable`, effort max) at `w3:p14`, sol-max (Codex `gpt-5.6-sol`, max) at
  `w3:p15`, grok-xhigh (Grok 4.6, xhigh) at `w3:p16`, terra-max (Codex
  `gpt-5.6-terra`, max) at `w3:p17`. All four confirmed working on briefs from
  `/tmp/raven-qadeep/brief-*.md`.
- `2026-08-25T21:58Z` — OpenCode TUI wedged twice for kimi-k3 (`w3:p18` closed;
  relaunched non-interactively as `opencode run` in new pane `w3:p19`). Report path
  moved in-repo to `research/qa-deep-dive-2026-08-25/kimi-k3.md` because
  non-interactive mode auto-rejects writes outside the project directory. Confirmed
  reading eval docs and working.
- `2026-08-25T22:20Z` — kimi-k3 stalled on an oversized single write attempt and
  looped no-op shell calls; killed PID and relaunched detached
  (`opencode run`, prompt file `/tmp/raven-qadeep/kimi-prompt2.txt`) with a
  chunked-write rule (each write under 3,000 characters). Confirmed working.
- `2026-08-25T22:47Z` — four pane lanes complete; reports archived to
  `research/qa-deep-dive-2026-08-25/`: fable-max (55,534 B), grok-xhigh
  (42,230 B), sol-max (33,678 B), terra-max (24,662 B). Orchestrator live probes:
  base-reserve routing/content verified discoverable via `stellarDocs.search_docs`;
  Scout wallet roster verified enumerable via `scout.searchProjects` (20 rows).
  Synthesis documents started.
- `2026-08-25T23:40Z` — kimi-k3 third launch succeeded after two stalls (oversized
  write; a rejected `rm`); report written in staged chunks to
  `research/qa-deep-dive-2026-08-25/kimi-k3.md` (24,124 B, citations verified live).
  All five lanes complete.
- `2026-08-25T23:45Z` — synthesis complete:
  `research/qa-miss-analysis-2026-08-25.md` and
  `research/qa-improvement-plan-2026-08-25.md`. Key consensus: retrieval/routing is
  the primary loss on only ~2 of 55 misses; answer discipline (~15–19) and source
  truth (~12–22) dominate; the wrong bucket is mostly measurement artifact; judge
  identical-input flip rate is 9.6%. Round ready for review.
- `2026-08-26T00:20Z` — owner decisions recorded: dating volatile claims is a product
  requirement (disclose to agents); grading is source-agnostic arrival-at-truth with
  docs-faithful answers capped at partial where a filed upstream defect stands;
  judging escalates to multi-org panels only for unstable cases driven by a per-case
  stability memory; goldens never downgrade off one cheap contradiction — deep
  multi-source verification required. See `research/qa-improvement-plan-2026-08-25.md`.
- `2026-08-26T00:35Z` — three Herdr worktrees created from `e488c4f`:
  `../sr-wt-measure` (`lane/measure-harness-20260825`, workspace `wB`),
  `../sr-wt-product` (`lane/product-executor-20260825`, `wC`),
  `../sr-wt-corpus` (`lane/corpus-goldens-20260825`, `wD`). Prior analysis agents
  released and terminated; their reports remain archived under
  `research/qa-deep-dive-2026-08-25/`. Builders started on worktree root panes:
  build-measure (`gpt-5.6-sol` high), build-product (`gpt-5.6-sol` xhigh),
  build-corpus (`gpt-5.6-sol` high). Briefs in `/tmp/raven-qadeep/build-*.md`.
  Integration gate after review: typecheck, test, test:smoke (product lane), build,
  routing/lint/selftest, corpus compile.
- `2026-08-26T09:25Z` — all three builders complete and committed on their branches;
  reports in `/tmp/raven-qadeep/build-{measure,product,corpus}.md`.
  - `lane/measure-harness-20260825` @ `2260ec6`: R8 recorded-revision rejudge +
    golden-drift refusal; R9 ungradeable-answer skip; A6 trap-precedence rule;
    A8 coreAnswer/coverage reporting; A1 opt-in `--judge-panel` with majority/tie
    rules. Gates: typecheck 0 errors; 1,242 tests pass; build pass.
  - `lane/product-executor-20260825` @ `49a7b65`: B1 payload-shape proxy trap
    (prototype-level; hot path preserved); B2 exact-path provenance sidecar into
    SOURCE BASIS (1,600-char cap kept); B3 evidence-discipline instructions block,
    1,998/2,000 chars. Gates incl `test:smoke`: all pass.
  - `lane/corpus-goldens-20260825` @ `cb14f14`: six authoring-warning lint classes
    (+1,362 warnings on existing corpus, warning-severity only); answering-contract
    dating/exactness line; symmetric cautions added where the rule fires (2 cases);
    WisdomTree CRDT golden issuer/SAC repaired against two live sources with dated
    receipts (toml + Horizon agree); battery recompiled at 499 cases.
- `2026-08-26T09:30Z` — independent reviewers started: review-judge (Claude `fable`)
  on measure+corpus diffs; review-executor (`gpt-5.6-sol` high) on product diff with
  security lens. Findings to `/tmp/raven-qadeep/review-{judge,executor}.md`.
- `2026-08-26T12:15Z` — reviews returned CHANGES-REQUESTED on all three branches with
  verified blocking findings: M-B1 (legacy agent-error rows still regraded — probe
  showed judge call still firing on the real SSRF row), M-B2 (`--allow-golden-drift`
  unreachable under revision pinning), E-B1 (SOURCE BASIS marker reused on
  untruncated results corrupts truncation semantics), E-B2 (prototype replacement
  broke instanceof/null-proto), C-B1 (consistency register would reopen 7 clusters
  silently), C-B2 (`freshness-drift` root cause false; old IDs failed CRC16 — they
  were never valid strkeys). Plus advisories.
- `2026-08-26T14:30Z` — all three builders landed fix commits addressing every
  blocking finding and the actionable advisories: `033ccd9` (legacy-error skip with
  regression test on the real artifact row; `--cases-ref worktree` unpinned mode;
  abstention-on-error panels; narrowed trap regex; casesPath mapping),
  `a7656b7` (distinct `--- SOURCE METADATA ---` marker with escaping against result
  spoofing; Object.create bridge restoring prototype chain; own-descriptor-only
  scans; smoke helper scoping; instruction wording restored at 2,000-char budget),
  `ec235d2` (CRDT rootCause corrected to transcription error per golden-truth skill,
  TODO entry added, improvements refs kept; avoid-lint exempts answer-visible dating).
  Updated reports in `/tmp/raven-qadeep/build-*.md`; lint warnings settled at 0
  errors / 1,390 warnings.
- `2026-08-26T18:50Z` — integration complete in main checkout: three `--no-ff`
  merges plus integration commit `83b6ec8`. Orchestrator-owned obligations done:
  evidence-pack/analyze-composition taught to treat SOURCE METADATA as non-loss
  (141 consumer tests pass; fixture provenance PASS) and consistency-register
  re-stamped with 7 dated reopens whose reconciliation rides the planned same-100
  rerun. Full gate battery green: typecheck clean; 85 files / 1,265 tests; build ok;
  smoke 4 / 82; eval:selftest pass; routing GATE PASS vs 2026-08-25 baseline;
  secrets scan clean. No push performed. Worktrees retained at `../sr-wt-*` with
  lane branches for inspection.
- `2026-08-26T19:20Z` — round documents committed (`b707953`): both synthesis docs,
  five lane reports, two review reports, three build reports, WisdomTree live
  receipts; working tree clean. Pull request opened:
  stellar-experimental/stellar-raven#68 (`qa/quality-round-2026-08-25`).
  Four other worktrees noted as NOT part of this round —
  `sr-wt-connectors-{guidance,item8,item8-baseline,item8-runtime}` belong to the
  separate connectors session (`wE`/`wH` agents) and were left untouched; their
  `item8` commits are not ancestors of main.
- `2026-08-27T00:10Z` — same-100 rerun history (all at variant A, ids from the
  2026-08-14 baseline):
  - Run 1 (`2026-08-26T20-56-34`) completed 100/100 but self-labeled
    non-comparable: the orchestrator edited this ledger mid-collection, dirtying
    the tree (runnerDirty guard fired correctly). Saved copy archived outside the
    repo at `/tmp/raven-qadeep/run1-noncomparable-variantA.json`. Directional:
    43/41/12/4, all nine targeted recoveries visible.
  - Run 2 (`2026-08-27T00:02` attempt at 21:01Z) invalidated: reused run 1's
    long-lived dev server; the server degraded around case 31 (90 consecutive
    non-correct). Lesson recorded: one freshly started dev server per collection.
    Artifact committed for forensics only if needed.
  - Run 3 (clean benchmark, `eval/qa/results/2026-08-27T00-02-11-variantA.json`,
    pinned `b707953…9bb465d` revision, fresh server, clean tree throughout,
    112 min): **48 correct / 35 partial / 13 wrong / 4 errors, half-credit 65.5%,
    strict 48.0%** vs baseline 64.5%/45.0%. First-ever instrument readings:
    **core-answer-correct 91.7%**, mean continuous coverage 71.7%. All 17 case
    improvements match round predictions (banked skill re-pins, golden repairs,
    symmetric cautions, judge fixes); churn within the known ±3–4 noise band.
    Errors decompose: 1 retryable agent `error_max_turns` (WisdomTree CRDT — the
    evidence-poor recovery gap), 3 deliberate consistency-engine downgrades whose
    judge grades were partial.

- `2026-08-27T17:00Z` — round two complete. Three lanes built in new worktrees
  (`sr-wt-discovery`, `sr-wt-judging`, `sr-wt-goldentruth`), each independently
  reviewed (Fable + Sol), all blockers fixed and re-verified to PASS (one residual
  alias-trigger gap caught on re-verify and closed). Golden-truth owner ran its own
  crew program: three Sol workers + Grok reviewer; three warning classes to zero;
  SEP-38 factual error fixed with two-source verification; lint 1,390 → 1,212.
  Foreign PRs #69–#71 landed mid-session on main; integrated by true-delta
  application with compiler/register proof and semantic unions on run-qa.mjs
  (safeJudge flows into judge adapters). Gates rebaselined (legacy top-5 312→311,
  card@5 94→95 = accepted wisdomtree trade). Final battery green: 88 files /
  1,362 tests, smoke 4/82, build ok, routing GATE PASS, lint 0/1,212, secrets
  clean. Pull request: stellar-experimental/stellar-raven#73
  (`qa/quality-round2-20260827`). Decision: LAND all three lanes.
- `2026-08-27T22:10Z` — Lane 3 reframed and drafted as an idea, not a decision:
  `ideas/source-delivery-ranked-references.md` on branch
  `lane3-source-delivery-idea-20260827`. Philosophy per owner: deliver scored,
  verifiable source pointers (repo/pinned-ref/path/locator/match-reason/
  verification-URL); never fetch content on the agent's behalf; no golden-QA
  overfit; battery is a regression check only. Drafted by Claude Fable; three
  Sol xhigh verification cycles (9 → 4 → 2 findings) ended APPROVE-DRAFT.
  Review records archived under `research/lane3-source-delivery-2026-08-27/`.
  Pull request: stellar-experimental/stellar-raven#75. Golden-truth crew
  session 2 in progress (negative-predicate class closed per program log;
  compound-predicate class underway; 6-hour stop-point declared).
- `2026-08-27T22:50Z` — two comments filed at 21:21Z, two minutes after PR #81
  merged at 21:19Z, received late corrections in substantive commit `cf68ca6`:
  `r3875968441` restored the positive network-reset
  grading requirement in `q-raph-secret-key-hash-recovery`, and `r3875968524`
  clarified the RP ID/origin fact in `q-passkey-platform-constraints`. A Grok 4.6
  high Spec review found one lost related-origin requirement; the follow-up restored
  it. A Claude Opus 5 high Standards review found six provenance, duplication, and
  ledger defects; the follow-up repaired all six. Corpus lint stayed at 0 errors and
  475 warnings. Compile output, the consistency register, baseline tests, build,
  secret scan, and both independent review axes passed before the follow-up PR.
- `2026-08-27T23:35Z` — golden-truth crew session 2 complete (owner Fable; 3 Sol
  workers + Grok reviewer; 58 worker prompts). Branch
  `lane/golden-truth-burndown-2-20260827` (stacked on the round-2 branch):
  negative-predicate 131→0 (127 cases), compound-predicate 188→0 (102 cases),
  long key facts 790→372 as a one-pass side effect. Lint 1,212 → **475 warnings,
  0 errors**. Zero factual edits; 35 reviewer FAILs were all form defects and
  were repaired; no escalations; register reconciled with dated re-sweeps.
  Honest tail: 372 long-fact warnings (expensive class, ~50 worker-prompts
  estimated) plus 103 out-of-scope. Report:
  `/tmp/raven-qadeep/golden-truth-owner2.md`; session assets `/tmp/raven-qadeep/gt2/`.
- `2026-08-28T00:10Z` — cleanup complete. All three PRs merged by squash:
  #73 (round two, `c242848`), #81 (crew session 2, `76d9f51`), #75 (lane-3
  idea, `cef3bbf`). Copilot review comments addressed pre-merge: four
  nullable `topScoreGap` assertions fixed; two gates.json consistency defects
  found by CI selftest (acceptedTotals sync, localTrace pointer) fixed.
  Session-2 merge conflicts resolved semantically (session-2 corpus newest;
  main kept test fixes; ledger unioned) and proven by compile, register,
  lint (0/475), selftest, and the full gate battery on main. Local main
  reset to origin/main; all eight of my worktrees removed via Herdr; my
  merged branches deleted locally; remote holds only `main`. Stashes: zero
  everywhere. The connectors program's twelve worktrees and branches are
  NOT mine and remain untouched. Follow-ups tracked in `.agents/TODO.md`.

## Outcome

The round completed through merged PRs #68, #73, #75, #81, and #83. Later cleanup removed every
round-owned worktree and branch. The connector worktrees noted above were also reconciled by their
separate round and no longer exist.

The durable research reports replace the temporary report paths in the lane table. The 2026-08-27
temporary-artifact audit reviewed every surviving report and routed all remaining work to
`.agents/TODO.md` or `ideas/`. The golden-truth session-3 handoff is now self-contained there.

The Lane 3 package supplied 12 recommendations, not owner decisions. The source-delivery idea now
records those recommendations and keeps its phase-zero spike unapproved. No other surviving
temporary report contains untracked work for this round.

## Historical-path correction — 2026-08-27

The four durable `research/qa-deep-dive-2026-08-25/` paths in the Lanes table are archive
locations. The original lanes wrote `/tmp/raven-qadeep/fable-max.md`, `sol-max.md`, `grok-xhigh.md`,
and `terra-max.md`. The later archive step copied those reports into the repository.

The durable audit record is
[`2026-08-27-tmp-artifact-audit.md`](./2026-08-27-tmp-artifact-audit.md).
