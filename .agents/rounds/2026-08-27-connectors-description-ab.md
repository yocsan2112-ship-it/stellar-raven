# Connector description A/B — 2026-08-27

Temporary report paths below are historical receipts. This ledger preserves their material
verdicts and reconciliations. A missing temporary report does not reopen the rejected candidate.

## Objective

Measure the held response-guidance candidate against the merged control.
Do not trim startup tool descriptions or server instructions.
Reject the candidate after any verified treatment regression.

## Current status — first raw pair blocked

The historical replacement qualification remains spent and non-comparable.
Do not run the historical qualification command below.
The user authorized one new treatment qualification on 2026-08-27.
It permitted one answering call, no judge call, and a `$1.75` per-call cap.
The user's broader spend tolerance does not remove the method-specific cap.
The user authorized A1 and B1 on 2026-08-27 after the qualification passed.
That authorization permitted `16` answering calls and no judge calls.
Each answering call has a `$1.75` cap, and the stage has a `$28.00` cap.
No retry, judging, replication, or method rerun is authorized.

Both v5 arms now include the postflight fix from PR `#72`.
The control stays at `7389e24880125ccf8fe0657a1435ca753dae52e6`.
The treatment reapplies the held change as `3966a59e77f2034726088e16be902270753211ae`.
Each arm uses its matching worktree and commit for both the server and runner.
The v5 method never pairs a runner from one commit with another server commit.
The independent pre-spend review returned `LAUNCH-OK`.
The replacement qualification then passed every machine and manual gate.
The first pair ran treatment A1 and then control B1.
Manual review found verified treatment regressions, so the candidate is rejected.
No replication, judging, retry, or other paid method is authorized.
The round closeout merged through PR `#77`.
Scout finding `sls-076` is reported upstream as issue `#1055`.

- The treatment server runs alone on port `8792` during treatment collection.
- The historical server on port `8791` remains outside this method.

The wrapper, real Claude binary, model, environment rules, qualification case,
and qualification case hashes remain pinned as recorded below.
The call uses the treatment server and runner from `3966a59e77f2034726088e16be902270753211ae`.
It must produce exactly one row and one reported answering cost.
The maximum cumulative task spend allowed under this one-call authorization is `$1.9886646`.

- Treatment lost the required Stellar Docs source on the MoneyGram case.
- Treatment skipped Scout prior-art discovery on the indexer greenfield case.
- Treatment escrow code leaves global state `Disputed` after a partial dispute resolution.
- That state blocks every remaining milestone from delivery, approval, automatic release, or dispute.
- Treatment also called the undefined `service.scout` namespace before repairing the call.
- The closed-world Strupey, partner soft-empty, simulation, and Wasm cases passed in both arms.
- Both arms incorrectly promoted `Stroopy.AI` into the open-world `Strupey` answer.

- New verified upstream finding: `sls-076`.
- First-pair decision: reject the treatment candidate.

Do not retry this command under the same authorization.

## Prior evidence

- PR `#69` merged the first harness hardening as `a0bdabe21465c68d466378a1a7a5a47c24e8ec71`.
- PR `#71` merged the MCP isolation correction as
  `94a18c27c6401e54081f5245d29f13b5279cb395`.
- The failed qualification artifact is
  `eval/qa/results/2026-08-27T14-33-04-variantA.json` in the local
  `sr-wt-connectors-product-20260827` worktree.
- That call cost `$0.0479258`.
- The failed row had no connected MCP server, so it supplied no product evidence.
- An earlier seven-call judge self-test cost `$0.0953632`.
- That self-test did not write a results file.
- Its captured command output reported:

```text
paid judge calls: expected=7 actual=7 reportedCosts=7 missingCosts=0 totalCostUsd=0.0953632
self-test GREEN
```

- The self-test did not evaluate the product candidate.
- Total paid spend before the `2026-08-27T15-43-06-variantA.json` call was `$0.1432890`.

## Method order

Steps 1 and 2 completed.
Steps 3 and 4 completed once.
Steps 5 and 6 completed and blocked the candidate.
Steps 7 through 10 remain unauthorized.

1. Run one replacement qualification against the treatment without judging.
2. Review its MCP connection, transcript, row count, costs, and comparison stamps.
3. Collect A1 without judging.
4. Collect B1 without judging.
5. Review every search projection, tool call, execute result, plan, and answer.
6. Stop after any treatment regression.
7. If the first pair passes, collect B2 and then A2.
8. Review all four raw artifacts.
9. Judge only after both raw pairs pass.
10. Run the offline plan grader and composition analyzer for all four artifacts.

No retry, repair, rejudge, replication, or method rerun is authorized.

## Mechanism gates

- MoneyGram uses Lumenloop, Scout, and Stellar Docs.
- The closed-world Strupey case stops at the named Scout directory.
- The open-world Strupey case makes one bounded broad pass.
- The open-world case validates identity, source, and date before attribution.
- The partner case distinguishes `soft-empty` from a failed call.
- The simulation case uses official technical evidence.
- The Wasm case avoids an unrelated Scout prior-art pass.
- Both greenfield cases use bounded prior-art discovery.
- Both greenfield cases retain an implementation plan.
- Treatment adds no invalid JavaScript, unknown operation, or envelope error.
- Treatment loses no required source family, plan fact, or correct claim.
- Treatment adds no wrong verdict.
- Repeated disagreement on a required gate makes the result inconclusive.

Aggregate scores are diagnostic.
A verified fact or mechanism regression overrides an aggregate gain.

## Historical v4 cost limits — superseded

These limits governed the stopped attempt.

- The replacement qualification permits one answering call with a `$1.75` cap.
- The first pair permits `16` answering calls.
- Each answering call has a `$1.75` cap.
- The first-pair cap is `$28.00`.
- A passing replication permits `16` more answering calls.
- Judging permits at most `32` calls with a `$0.50` cap each.
- The product comparison permits at most `64` calls and `$72.00`.
- The approved stage allowed at most `72` calls and `$77.25`.
- That ceiling included the prior `$0.0479258` call when the brief was approved.
- The wrapper enforces each call limit.
- Every method rerun needs a new authorization.
- The seven-call self-test and the replacement qualification count toward task spend.
- Counted task spend at the stopped v4 checkpoint was `$0.2386646`.
- That historical authorization has no remaining paid method.

## Stop rules

- Stop without a reconciled independent `LAUNCH-OK` review.
- Stop if `raven` is not connected during replacement qualification.
- Stop if either worktree is dirty or lacks an immutable commit.
- Stop if the treatment diff includes an unplanned file.
- Stop if any case, revision, surface, model, wrapper, or environment pin differs.
- Stop if another Wrangler process conflicts with port `8792`.
- Stop after a missing row, agent failure, missing cost, or wrapper limit.
- Stop after any first-pair mechanism regression.
- Stop after a judge error or comparability failure.

## Historical replacement qualification command — spent

This command ran once and produced a non-comparable artifact.
Do not run it again under this brief.

## Independent review

Before paid work, a Grok high reviewer must inspect this brief, both arm diffs, all pins,
the budget mechanism, and the replacement qualification command.
The reviewer must write `LAUNCH-OK` or list blocking findings.

After collection, reviewers must inspect every raw row and every judge verdict.
The author, orchestrator, and closeout reviewer must differ.

### Pre-spend result

- Reviewer: Grok 4.6, high effort.
- Report: `/tmp/connectors-v4-launch-review.md`.
- Report SHA-256: `322ad0cfbbf32b20643e99346722a2d1d8dce0c275f47775171f31278396f393`.
- Verdict: `LAUNCH-OK`.
- The reviewer confirmed both revisions, both surfaces, the wrapper, the case hashes,
  the ten-file treatment diff, the v4 isolation repair, and one server on port `8791`.
- Every paid command will repeat the wrapper preamble.
- Every product command will carry the exact eight-id list.
- Every arm swap will stop the old server and verify the new live surface.
- Qualification must report `qa-agent-result-v4`, `isolation.safeMode: false`,
  a matching wrapper, a connected `raven` server, no row failure, and a reported cost.
- At review time, the planned remaining scope was `65` calls with `$73.75` in per-call caps.
- That planned scope is now blocked and has no authorization.
- The unnamed slack in the wider ceiling is not authorized as a method.
- The whole treatment commit is the attribution unit.
- `/demo` behavior is outside this QA comparison.

## Historical v4 outcome

The replacement qualification ran once and then stopped on the comparability rule.

- Artifact:
  `eval/qa/results/2026-08-27T15-43-06-variantA.json` in the local
  `sr-wt-connectors-v4-product` worktree.
- Cost: `$0.0953756`.
- Total paid spend for this task is now `$0.2386646`.
- The row used `qa-agent-result-v4` and `isolation.safeMode: false`.
- The wrapper matched and reported its cost.
- The explicit `raven` MCP server was connected.
- The answer completed with three tool calls and no agent failure.
- The postflight failed with `fetch failed`, so comparability was suppressed.
- Wrangler stayed healthy and kept the same listener, revision, worktree, and surface.
- A fresh free postflight passed immediately.
- Free report: `/tmp/raven-connectors-v4-product-postfailure-surface.json`.
- Free report SHA-256: `b2b8f66972fd898a608b975baaffffdb9438a23a01ad0591288a380b88f138bd`.
- The report was captured at `2026-08-27T15:43:29.994Z`.
- It matched treatment revision `3792571ec4c3ac8b93f8d92debd9e903cafcacb5` and the treatment surface pin.

The root cause is a QA harness socket-lifetime defect.
`spawnSync` blocks Node's event loop while Wrangler closes the idle preflight keep-alive socket.
The immediate postflight reused the stale socket and received `ECONNRESET`.

PR `#72` merged the harness fix as
`7389e24880125ccf8fe0657a1435ca753dae52e6`.
The regression test reproduces the failure through `probeLiveSurface` and `fetchLiveSurface`.
The fix protects QA and paid discovery probes with fresh connections.
CI, CodeQL, and the secret scan passed on PR head
`01b0a3d72b3be7937de0c0e82f92f3a36db99b25`.
[Copilot's final review on PR #72](https://github.com/stellar-experimental/stellar-raven/pull/72)
covered all five files on that head and reported no new comments.
Its two earlier comments were fixed, verified, and resolved.

The standards reviewer used Claude Opus at high effort.
Its final report SHA-256 is
`2aae9787d8a1e48040e5f229f2b6c6f1434473ba987b0348c56ba17564f18629`.
It reported no blocking standards finding on `01b0a3d`.
The specification reviewer used Grok 4.6 at high effort.
Its final report SHA-256 is
`8d90592ac67d82fed257ecb6bb5b17791fe14e334a297344891187457a612417`.
It reported no missing requirement, scope issue, or incorrect behavior on `01b0a3d`.
These verdicts and hashes preserve the local review results in this ledger.

No product A/B call ran under the stopped v4 method.
The v5 first pair now has the separate bounded authorization recorded above.

## Outcome

The v5 treatment qualification passed. The first raw pair then produced eight complete and
comparable rows per arm. No judge, retry, replication, or method rerun occurred.

- Verdict: `FIRST-PAIR-BLOCK`; reject the treatment candidate.
- Treatment A1: `2026-08-27T18-50-04-variantA.json`, SHA-256

  `78170de4d3879d3a54d248309337500be58b40bb79b4e2bf58238a0c5cf2a295`.
- First-pair cost: `$4.6188030`; total task spend: `$4.9673564`.
- Treatment regressions: missing MoneyGram Docs evidence, skipped indexer prior art, and a frozen
  escrow dispute lifecycle.
- Shared upstream defect: `sls-076`, reported as
  `https://github.com/Stellar-Light/stellarlight/issues/1055`.

  `16f9c6719b16e81499e4bde7dc7f38174f41161e`.
- Final round record: `https://github.com/stellar-experimental/stellar-raven/pull/79`.

Every failure was triaged. The rejected treatment needs no own-repository follow-up.
The shared Scout defect was verified, committed, filed, and read back.
The relevant checks and improvements lints passed. The owned evaluation server stopped cleanly.

## Audit-note correction — 2026-08-27

The temporary-artifact audit added the opening note after this round completed. The original round
began at `Objective`. The final rejection and follow-up state remain in this ledger's Outcome.
