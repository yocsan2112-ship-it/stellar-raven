# Agent queue closeout — 2026-09-02

Status: complete

## Scope

This round closes the agent-queue integration branch. It reconciles `.agents/NEXT.md`,
`.agents/TODO.md`, the dated round ledgers, and the two evaluation READMEs with the six
integrated blocks. It changes no product code, generated artifact, gate, golden, or contract.
It makes no provider call. The owner authorized push, pull-request creation, and merge for this
task. Deployment is out of scope and needs separate authorization.

## Integrated commits

Base: `3428631` (`main`, PR #116).

PR #117 was squash-merged. These commits, `8088467`, and `c11b185` remain reachable through
`refs/pull/117/head`.

Each block has an independent review with a final passing closure recorded in its ledger.

## Durable review

The read-only closeout audit is
`.agents/rounds/2026-09-02-agent-queue-closeout/review-fable.md`.
Author: Claude Fable 5.1, high effort. Mode: audit only, against HEAD `1421ffe`.
It applied `audit-reviewability` and `writing-for-agents`.
The `c4a064b` evidence-pack commit landed after that audit. This ledger accounts for it.

## Findings closed

The Fable audit recorded nine findings. Grok independently verified every repair.

| Finding | Severity | Target | Repair | State |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F1 | High | `.agents/NEXT.md` | Full rewrite per audit section 9.1, adapted to `c4a064b` | closed |
| F2 | Medium | `.agents/TODO.md` | Delete the completed `--ids` selector item | closed |
| F3 | Medium | `.agents/TODO.md` | Replace the "Permitted now" paragraph with the free-evidence result | closed |
| F4 | Medium | `eval/README.md` | Add the 2026-09-02 re-baseline section | closed |
| F5 | Medium | `.agents/rounds/2026-09-02-protocol-history-free-evidence.md` | Append the manifest `4cd28f4b…` reconciliation | closed |
| F6 | Medium | `.agents/rounds/2026-09-01-stale-gospel-refresh.md` | Status line and merged-as `8ee41f3` Outcome line | closed |
| F7 | Low | `eval/vectorize/README.md` | Record the 2026-09-02 clause artifact rebuild and pins | closed |
| F8 | Low | `.agents/rounds/2026-09-02-av-created-at-semantics.md` | Cite the final bounded delta review by name | closed |
| F9 | Low | `.agents/rounds/2026-09-02-ids-selector-guards.md` | Append the superseded-by line | closed |

Adaptation for `c4a064b`: the audit's proposed `NEXT.md` listed the evidence-pack lane as in
progress. The lane is complete. Pack `p6` omits detected A/V `created_at` values and derived
`date` fields. Non-A/V fixtures are byte-identical. The final Opus 5 closure verdict is `PASS`.
`NEXT.md` now records no unconditional machine-ready block.

## Integration verification

- `npm run typecheck` passed.
- Six focused suites passed with 260 tests.
- `npm test` passed with 100 files and 1,692 tests.
- `npm run build` passed.
- `npm run test:smoke` passed with four files and 82 tests.
- `npm run eval:selftest` passed.
- `npm run eval:routing -- --gate` passed the four committed baselines.
- `npm run eval:qa:compile` compiled 500 cases and a 30-case sample.
- `npm run eval:qa:lint -- --stale` reported zero errors and 62 accepted warnings.
- `npm run improvements:index` and `npm run improvements:lint` passed for 66 findings.

`npm run eval:protocol-history` exited one because the frozen diagnostic still fails by design.
It reported 4/8 original positives, 2/4 original controls, 3/11 blind positives, and 6/9 blind
controls. The three-attempt box remains spent.

`node eval/qa/verify-evidence-pack-fixtures.mjs` could not run against ten absent ignored result
artifacts. The committed eight-fixture non-A/V comparison passed during the `c4a064b` review.
No saved artifact was available to recreate the missing ignored files.

The final tree passed `npm run secrets:scan -- --tree` and `git diff --check`.

PR #117 completed the authorized push, checks, and merge as `5774a1e`.
Deployment and production verification remain separate owner gates under `NEXT.md` stage 6.
The Fable high post-merge documentation review is
[`post-merge-docs-review-fable.md`](2026-09-02-agent-queue-closeout/post-merge-docs-review-fable.md).
Its L1 finding required the durable `refs/pull/117/head` reachability note.
The final closure review is
[`post-merge-docs-review-fable-closure.md`](2026-09-02-agent-queue-closeout/post-merge-docs-review-fable-closure.md).
It passed with no remaining finding.

## CI EPIPE repair

Linux CI exposed a duplicate fake judge call after this closeout.
The first CI attempt failed three cases.
The second CI attempt failed one different case at `test/qa-harness-preconditions.test.mjs:801`.
Both failures recorded two calls where the test required one call.

The Opus 5 high diagnosis is
[`ci-test-diagnosis-opus.md`](2026-09-02-agent-queue-closeout/ci-test-diagnosis-opus.md).
The fake Claude exited without reading standard input.
Linux then returned status 0, complete stdout, and an EPIPE spawn error.
`judgeCase` classified that result as a retryable CLI failure.
The stored judge path then made a second call.

The fake Claude now drains standard input before it logs and prints.
The exact one-call assertions remain in place and include failure messages.
`judgeCase` now treats status-zero EPIPE as a terminal `prompt-write` failure.
The child did not receive the complete prompt, so its verdict is not valid.
The failure keeps the bounded CLI evidence and reported cost.
`isRetryableJudgeError` rejects this class, so stored judging makes no second call.
Normal CLI and parse failures keep their existing one-retry behavior.
Nonzero EPIPE and other spawn errors remain CLI failures.

The Opus 5 high repair review is
[`ci-epipe-review-opus.md`](2026-09-02-agent-queue-closeout/ci-epipe-review-opus.md).
F1 rejected the silent acceptance of an incomplete prompt.
The terminal `prompt-write` class closes F1 without trusting the returned verdict.
F2 required tests that prove the real EPIPE precondition.
Both status-zero tests now require EPIPE evidence and a terminal result.
The helper explains why its 4 MiB input exceeds the 64 KiB Linux pipe buffer.

The focused command was
`npm test -- --run test/qa-judge-evidence.test.mjs test/qa-budget.test.mjs test/qa-verdict-consistency.test.mjs test/qa-harness-preconditions.test.mjs`.
It passed four files and 278 tests.
The real `judgeCase` tests use a local fake executable and make no provider call.

The Opus 5 high closure review is
[`ci-epipe-review-opus-closure.md`](2026-09-02-agent-queue-closeout/ci-epipe-review-opus-closure.md).
N1 found that `prompt-write` was absent from the five-track failure buckets.
T4 now reports `judgePromptWriteFailures` and prints every contributing ID.
Focused tests prove that the class stays outside all existing T4 and T5 failure buckets.
N2 found that the QA README omitted `prompt-write` from the terminal class list.
The README now defines the status-zero EPIPE condition and explains why the verdict is invalid.

The Opus 5 high final closure review is
[`ci-epipe-review-opus-final-closure.md`](2026-09-02-agent-queue-closeout/ci-epipe-review-opus-final-closure.md).
It closed F1, F2, N1, and N2 with no new finding.

`QA_TRACK_SCHEMA` remains `qa-five-track-v1`.
The new bucket is additive and fulfills the existing v1 T4 harness-health contract.
It changes no existing key semantics or comparability rule.
`npm test -- --run test/qa-five-track.test.mjs` passed one file and nine tests.

## Outcome

The six integrated blocks and their queue documentation are complete.
All required code, evaluation, review, secret, and diff checks passed.
The missing ignored evidence artifacts remain an environment limit, not a product regression.
The EPIPE closure review passed after the N1 and N2 repair.
PR #117 squash-merged the complete branch to `main` as `5774a1e`.
Deployment remains outside this round and needs separate authorization.
