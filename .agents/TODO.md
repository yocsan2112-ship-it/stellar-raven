# TODO — own-repo work queue

Own-repo fixes only: adapters, normalizers, catalog, executor, scoring, eval instruments, goldens,
gates, and documentation. Upstream service defects go to `improvements/` instead — see
`improvements/README.md` for the routing rule.

Add an item when you find work you are not doing now. Delete it when it is done; git history is the
archive. Each item states what is wrong, how it was found, and what "done" means.

The latest maintenance work is [the September 16 ledger](rounds/2026-09-16-maintenance-execution.md).
[NEXT.md](NEXT.md) ranks the work and holds open owner decisions.

## Improvements follow-up

### Complete the September 14 source-metadata follow-up before 2026-10-01

The freshness audit found a dead CLI cookbook link in `q-ti-stellar-lab-usage-and-new-ui`.
It also identified dated x402 board membership and builder-population facts in sibling cases.
Use `research/audits/2026-09-14-golden-freshness-review.md` for the exact cases and replacement source.
Apply the golden-truth workflow to source metadata and any factual changes.
Preserve historical observations and scheduled dates unless new verification supports a change.

Done when: the source link works, sibling claims have current evidence, and the corpus gates pass.

### Re-check `sd-027` and `sd-034` after PR #2837 receives a maintainer decision

PR https://github.com/stellar/stellar-docs/pull/2367 closed without merge on 2026-09-09.
The maintainer named https://github.com/stellar/stellar-docs/pull/2837 as its replacement.
The reviewed repair reached PR #2837 at `108ba24e0884f46e0c543996e4e94be754709840` on September 16.
All nine checks passed. Required maintainer approval and the author’s explicit merge hold remain.
The author must reconcile the hold with the updated template and remaining review concerns.

Re-check the replacement PR on 2026-09-21, or earlier if its head changes or it closes.
If it merges and deploys, run both original live page checks before changing either finding.
Do not post a status comment while the maintainers are already working on the decision.
Use `.agents/rounds/2026-09-16-maintenance-execution.md` for the current state.

Done when: each finding records the resulting live state, and any fixed finding completes the resolver gates.

### Decide the follow-up for stale-bot-closed `sd-037`

Issue https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/issues/1981 closed as `NOT_PLANNED` on 2026-09-14.
The September 14 source check still reproduces the missing proposal index.
The closure followed a stale-bot warning, not a maintainer scope decision.
Keep the finding reported upstream. Do not post a keep-alive comment.
At the next owner review, decide whether to reopen the issue or propose a successor.
Evidence: `.agents/rounds/2026-09-14-truth-maintenance.md`.

Done when: an owner decides the follow-up based on the original trigger and current upstream scope.

## Recovery

### Monitor the rejected repository-tooling recovery experiment

The record-only closeout is in
`.agents/rounds/2026-08-31-rejected-experiments-closeout.md`.
The rejected `repository-tooling-recovery-v2` implementation does not ship.
The v2 collection returned 9 of 12 positives and 0 of 8 premature detours.
It had 18 of 20 correct answers and 20 of 20 grounded answers.

`sls-080` is retired in `improvements/resolved.json`.
The deployed API `1.9.16` reading returned `28` at `2026-09-01T20:08:07.092Z`.
Its scanned ref was `82660510ecda7fd365a14d08badb9d85fa22bc32`, whose source value is also `28`.
The 2026-09-03 reading returned `28` at `2026-09-03T18:20:47.059Z` with the same scanned ref and
`answerSource: knowledge-note`. It passed. The record is
`.agents/rounds/2026-09-03-truth-maintenance/sls-080-monitor-terra.md`.

During each improvements or drift-maintenance round, run one free `scout.explainRepo` reading
against the existing local Raven server. Ask: “Which Horizon ingestion constant pins the highest
supported protocol version, and what is its value?” Use repository `stellar/stellar-horizon`.
Record the returned value, `generatedAt`, `scannedRef`, and `answerSource` in the current round ledger.
Use the `sls-080` receipt in `improvements/resolved.json` as the durable finding record.

The freshness blocker clears only when the DeepWiki answer equals the source value at the
response's own `scannedRef`. The current source value is `28`; the match rule is not a permanent
literal-`28` rule.

The selection trigger remains three qualifying positive operation-selection misses after recovery.
The Docs-versus-repository conflict remains monitor-only until three successful-recovery
recurrences. Each recurrence must be a dated re-execution of `sls-080`. It must use the required
Docs-first, inspect, then one-later-`scout.explainRepo` sequence. Record the same finding identity,
the case ID, the result stamp, and the transcript for every recurrence.
The `stellar-cli` fallback candidate did not reproduce and has no active finding.
G1 is a pre-registered v3 candidate only.

A matching free reading does not authorize a paid collection. A new recovery plan must cite
ADR-0008. It must retain the 10-of-12 positive and 0-of-8 premature-detour gate. Ranking remains
blocked until three qualifying positive misses remain after recovery. Any paid collection needs
an independent plan review and its own spend authorization.

G1's detailed record is in closed PR #102 at commit `6baec0a4`. Fetch it with
`git fetch origin pull/102/head` if this block reopens.

Done when: a reviewed v3 plan later passes ADR-0008 and ships, or the owner retires this recovery
program. Select each later Scout ID from the maximum active and resolved ID; `sls-081` is historical only.

## Routing

### `search` does not surface the research lane for protocol-history questions

Eval case `q-protocol-24-whisk-incident` asks why Protocol 24 followed Protocol 23 so quickly. The
answer needs the eviction-defect cause, the counts 478 / 84 / 77 / 394, `CAP-0076`, Hot Archive,
and a 31,879,035-stroop fee-pool remediation.

`scout.searchResearch` holds all of them. `source: "cap"` returns 478, 84, 77, 394, Hot Archive,
and TTL; a broad call returns 478, 84, 77, 31879035, `CAP-0076`, and Hot Archive. The union is the
complete fact set, so this question is fully answerable today.

`search` does not point there. Measured 2026-08-25 with the case's own wording: ten hits, none of
them `scout.searchResearch`. The top hits were `stellarDocs.*` operations, and no Stellar Docs
lane carries a single required fact.

This is not a description gap. `scout.searchResearch` already advertises "incident reports" and
offers `source` values `cap` and `incident`. The lane says what it is; ranking does not find it.

The 2026-08-31 `clause-fit-hysteresis-v1` measurement produced a reviewed `FAIL`.
No grid passed both frozen contracts with the routing gates intact.
Its result stamp is `2026-08-31T16-58-42-389Z-clause-fit-hysteresis-v1`, and its clause artifact
SHA-256 is `e5f86644af89158c3ac4d61ee7f651e2a062c9d292f194cb94872c7eee4e71f4`.
Attempt one is spent.

The 2026-08-31 `cross-encoder-fit-v1` measurement also produced a verified `FAIL`.
Every registered grid kept both frozen contracts at the lexical baseline and failed the routing
gate. Its result stamp is `2026-08-31T23-36-38-660Z-cross-encoder-fit-v1`, and its result
SHA-256 is `529351b1562b14f68d18ef94b584ca37ae61290f68cfff7a5a1489e8b601ae0d`. The full record
is `.agents/rounds/2026-08-31-protocol-history-cross-encoder-v1.md`. Attempt two is spent.

The 2026-09-01 `clause-support-fit-v1` measurement also produced a verified `FAIL`.
It used cache-only multi-clause aggregation over the retained attempt-two pair scores.
Its result stamp is `2026-09-01T14-22-28-993Z-clause-support-fit-v1`.
Its result SHA-256 is
`a522bfa28ef4b06146c5f247ba64c08bfd6edaa4a81a0642c4010da2d6de479c`.
Blind top-five rose from 3/11 to 10/11. Control captures also rose to 2/4 and 7/9.
The routing gate failed on legacy, holdout, extended, and protocol-version top-one.
The full record is `.agents/rounds/2026-09-01-protocol-history-attempt-three.md`.
Attempt three is spent, so the three-attempt box is spent. No fourth attempt is authorized.
No production change shipped, and no `improvements/` finding applies.

The free evidence is complete in `.agents/rounds/2026-09-02-protocol-history-free-evidence.md`.
The blind label review disputes four of 13 frozen controls: `ph-control-validator-vote`,
`ph-control-clawback-cap`, `phb-control-sdk-version-history`, and
`phb-control-cap-history-sep-support`. All 19 positive labels hold. The product-exposure union
contains 78 QA cases. It combines the 76-case
`scout.searchResearch` inventory and four-case protocol-history family, with two shared cases.
The attempt-one result file is absent locally, so its matrix column remains `NA`.
On manifest `4cd28f4b…fe8b`, the original diagnostic reads 4/8 positives and 2/4 controls.
`ph-control-validator-vote` reaches rank five without a new mechanism. The blind set reads 3/11
positives and 6/9 controls. These results informed the PH2 owner decision. They do not authorize
PH3.

The owner resolved PH2 on 2026-09-03. The v2 contracts retain all 19 required cases, keep nine
valid controls as forbidden, and mark the four disputed controls neutral. Neutral ranks remain
visible but do not affect pass or fail. The v1 contracts remain byte-identical historical inputs.
The decision record is `.agents/rounds/2026-09-03-owner-decisions.md`.

The current v2 baseline reaches 7 of 19 required cases. It captures five of nine forbidden cases.
Three of four neutral cases also surface the target. Both v2 contracts remain diagnostic `FAIL`.

Since the accepted 2026-09-03 Docs-only title refresh, the committed manifest is
`b613201846076e9fbaa70edfee4f506841c7cf690265e69c8d07afde567f6729`. Both v2 contracts pin the
earlier epoch `4cd28f4b…fe8b`, so `npm run eval:protocol-history` now stops as `source-expired`
before scoring and returns no counts. That stop is correct. Do not repin the v2 epoch to the
current manifest. A new epoch needs a new independently authored contract after an accepted
source freeze. That is an owner evidence box under PH3. The rejected Scout 1.9.23 candidate fired
PH1 on 2026-09-03 and its counts are in the round ledger. The committed inventory did not change,
so PH1 has not fired on the accepted surface.

The rejected Scout 1.9.48 candidate also fired PH1 on 2026-09-08.
Both v2 contracts stopped as `source-expired` before scoring.
The result authorizes no new epoch, mechanism, or baseline change.
That dated rejection retained Scout 1.9.1.
The 2026-09-16 accepted source is Scout 1.9.52. Both v2 contracts still stop as `source-expired`.
No question was scored and no contract was repinned. See `rounds/2026-09-16-scout-acceptance.md`.

This queue calls the dated brief's T1 to T4 triggers `PH1` to `PH4`. This avoids collision with
the five-track T1 to T5 contract.

- **PH1 — dual upstream card change.** Both hashes must change together. The
  `inventory/stellar-light.json` SHA-256 must differ from
  `1a261c4a2e2172683e91a52ddc33b02ff41e74760c861dfacb29c60a8d8671b0`. The
  `sha256(JSON.stringify(openapi.paths["/api/research"].get["x-routing"]))` value must differ from
  `468a9d9834e8cb50cb905f80ccc42f9d3daa7a3d0ff2d8c5194d566812ba716b`. Routine inventory drift
  alone does not fire PH1. The drift lane may run the free `npm run eval:protocol-history`
  diagnostic and record both contract counts. PH1 does not authorize a new mechanism.
- **PH2 — completed owner contract decision.** The versioned v2 contract uses 19 required, nine
  forbidden, and four neutral cases. It preserves the 19-of-19 required bar and all v1 evidence.
- **PH3 — new non-card evidence box.** The owner can open a box for corpus-derived route vocabulary
  or another named non-card source. The brief must carry every pre-registration item from the
  attempt-three brief, section 16. Independent review must pass before any fetch.
- **PH4 — new live routing evidence.** Two cases must show the same absent-lane pattern. They must
  use different question families and entities. Neither can paraphrase a frozen positive. Each case
  needs a dated transcript. PH4 opens a TODO note and a token-reachability audit. The owner then
  decides whether the new evidence opens PH3. PH4 does not open a mechanism box by itself.

Run `npm run eval:protocol-history` as a free diagnostic after changes to `src/catalog/**`,
`catalog/manifest.json`, `scripts/build-catalog.mjs`, or
`src/catalog/vendor/search-scoring.ts`. Record the counts when the contracts are eligible. Record
`source-expired` when they are not. Keep this lane diagnostic-only.

Done when: a later reviewed mechanism passes both v2 contracts and all routing gates. That requires
19 of 19 required top-five hits and zero captures among nine forbidden cases. Neutral cases remain
diagnostic. The attempt-three section 8 table remains historical and is not the current ship gate.
One new target capture or one-case improvement does not close this item.

Filed here and not in `improvements/`: the data is reachable, so there is no upstream gap. This is
our ranking.

### Preserve structured routing intent across extraction caps and gate tiers

The rejected search and Scout candidates are retired, not pending implementations.
Their disposition is recorded in `rounds/2026-09-09-outstanding-closeout.md#rejected-candidate-retirement--2026-09-10`.
PR #148 supplied the accepted bounded search repair. This item retains the broader source-acceptance requirements for #141.
Use current accepted main and a fresh source snapshot for any later authorized repair.

Trigger only after the current truth-maintenance round closes and the owner authorizes a general
Raven scoring repair. The 2026-09-03 Scout routing attribution found eight real regressions from
phrase flattening, first-token truncation, generic schema-word coverage, substring coverage, and
five weak gated rows. It also found valid leaderboard and RFP gains. This item does not authorize
the rejected Scout surface, a routing-baseline change, operation-specific exceptions, or
question-specific exceptions. Keep the protocol-history measurement source-expired for the rejected
Scout surface.

Keep phrase and field boundaries from `x-routing` during scoring. Replace first-token truncation
with deterministic fair allocation. Retain specific older intent when a source adds long sections.
Stop generic response-property names and unrelated substrings inside schema words from satisfying
the coverage gate. Let strong ungated cross-service evidence compete with five weak gated rows.
The 2026-09-04 category check is another instance. A controlled-vocabulary operation did not reach
the top five for two general directory-taxonomy queries. The existing compiled category case also
missed its expected operation. Do not add query wording or an operation exception. Include this
family in the next reviewed general scoring design.
The rejected Scout 1.9.30 surface changed 15 `x-routing` blocks and 22 direct schemas. Its routing
diagnostic met the numeric floors without an accepted intent decision. The record is
`.agents/rounds/2026-09-03-truth-maintenance/scout-1.9.30-drift-terra.md`. It adds no new
acceptance check.
The rejected Scout 1.9.48 surface added `GET /api/rwa`.
Its new card captured 52 of 495 ranked cases, including Friendbot, RPC, WASM, simulation, and
balance questions. The operation also lacked accepted intent coverage.
Keep `GET /api/rwa` excluded until the general scoring repair passes the added check below.
The upstream request and response state enums must also match the live handler.
Scout 1.9.49 fixes those upstream enums, but the full source candidate still fails the intent checks.
It introduces 61 RWA top-five captures across the routing and holdout cases, including unrelated implementation questions.
The independent rejection is `rounds/2026-09-09-scout-drift-terra.md`.
That dated rejection retained Scout 1.9.1. The 2026-09-16 acceptance advances to Scout 1.9.52.
Issue #167 owns the remaining RWA routing work. No new upstream enum correction is established.
The 2026-09-16 experimental Scout 1.9.52 candidate keeps `GET /api/rwa` excluded from the
release manifest. Its direct discovery checks pass, but three added controls remain open. The
operation captures a tokenized-bond RPC simulation, a tokenized-treasury wallet-balance question,
and the existing issuer fee, supply-cap, and holder-freeze question. These are Raven structured
routing defects. They are not established upstream schema defects. Keep the controls in the round
evidence and require a reviewed general intent mechanism before any RWA exposure decision.
The same round repaired stablecoin discovery, Soroswap lookup, and dated Blend research routing.
Independent semantic and code reviews accepted the final existing-operation candidate.
The runtime repair improves all 13 query medians in both measurements against the accepted control.
The pooled median improves about 10%, and the pooled p95 improves about 38%.
These are local search measurements, not network or model response times.
See `rounds/2026-09-16-scout-acceptance.md` for source, gate, and review evidence.
[Issue #167](https://github.com/stellar-experimental/stellar-raven/issues/167) tracks the three deferred RWA controls.
The original eleven-check program remains incomplete while RWA exposure stays deferred.
This item also owns the `sls-078` residual. Scout fixed its quality `x-routing`
contract in 1.9.13. The reviewed 1.9.23 candidate still caused 90 unrelated
`scout.getQualityReport` captures through Raven response-schema keywords. Keep
`GET /api/quality` excluded until this general repair passes. Do not create a
separate routing TODO or upstream successor.

Acceptance checks:

1. Protocol-history additions do not remove `yieldblox` or `reflector` intent.
2. `through`, `network`, `each`, and `walk through` cannot route alone.
3. `contract` cannot route `explainRepo` without a repository or code anchor.
4. Added `use` cannot promote `hackathonBrief` above account-merge Docs.
5. `has` cannot match inside the schema keyword `phase`.
6. Strong Docs evidence remains eligible after five weak gated Scout candidates.
7. All eight regression rows meet their clean grades.
8. A general RWA query reaches `scout.getRwaAssets`, while unrelated Friendbot, RPC, WASM,
   simulation, and balance questions do not capture it.
9. The leaderboard and RFP improvements remain.
10. The full legacy, extended, skills, and holdout gates do not regress.
11. A controlled-vocabulary operation reaches the top five for general directory-taxonomy queries.

Done when: all eleven acceptance checks pass in a reviewed general scoring change. The existing
protocol-history diagnostic stays source-expired until a separate accepted Scout source epoch exists.

## Dependencies

### Re-check the seven remaining dependency audit findings

The 2026-09-17 toolchain update cleared the Hono finding and the root Wrangler finding.
It pins Wrangler 4.133.0 and Hono 4.13.8, and it raises the `@cloudflare/workers-types` floor to Wrangler's peer requirement.
Seven high findings remain. They come from two exact pins.

`@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` 0.22.0 pins its own test tools:

- `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` 0.22.0;
- nested `wrangler` 4.124.0;
- `miniflare` 5.20260815.0-alpha;
- `sharp` 0.35.2 under miniflare (GHSA-rgj7-g3m4-5g8c, also reported for root `sharp` 0.34.5).

`@huggingface/transformers` stays at 4.2.0, which holds its runtime chain:

- `@huggingface/transformers` 4.2.0;
- `onnxruntime-node` 1.24.3;
- `adm-zip` 0.5.18 (GHSA-xcpc-8h2w-3j85 and GHSA-vwc7-r8mq-g2x9);
- root `sharp` 0.34.5 (GHSA-f88m-g3jw-g9cj and GHSA-rgj7-g3m4-5g8c).

Both groups are development tools only. The pool serves the `test:smoke` lane. Transformers serves the eval Vectorize tools.
npm offers only a pool downgrade to 0.8.30, which breaks the vitest 4 smoke config. Do not use it or an override.
Transformers 4.3.0 clears its chain, but it waits for the Vectorize runtime migration below.

Two local workerd runtimes coexist.
`wrangler dev` and `npm run build` use `workerd` 1.20260916.1.
The smoke pool and `@cloudflare/unenv-preset` use `workerd` 1.20260815.1.
Evidence is in `research/audits/2026-09-17-dependency-audit/`.

Done when: a pool release newer than 0.22.0 passes `npm run test:smoke`, and the runtime migration lands Transformers 4.3.0 or later.

### Plan the Vectorize Transformers runtime migration

The Vectorize models are registered on `@huggingface/transformers@4.2.0` (`eval/vectorize/frontier-config.mjs` and `eval/vectorize/rerank-config.mjs`).
The loaders require each banked artifact's `model` to equal that registration exactly.

The preflights cannot compare a candidate runtime today, for three reasons:

- `preflight-clause-model.mjs` and `preflight-rerank-model.mjs` print a probe hash, but they compare it with no committed expected value.
- Neither preflight output nor the score-cache environment records the Transformers version. They record `onnxruntimeNode` only.
- One tree installs one Transformers version. A preflight therefore cannot run the registered runtime and a candidate runtime side by side.

The accepted rerank probe hash exists only in a round ledger (`.agents/rounds/2026-08-31-protocol-history-cross-encoder-v1.md`).
The run supplies it through `RAVEN_RERANK_PROBE_SCORE_SHA256`.

Define a comparison before any upgrade.
Record the Transformers version and the probe outputs in committed form.
Run the preflights on 4.2.0 and on the candidate runtime in separate trees.
Decide from the result whether to re-register the runtime and rebuild the artifacts.

Done when: a reviewed comparison accepts or rejects the candidate runtime, and the registrations and artifacts match the installed runtime.

## Eval instruments

### Re-check the upstream codemode short-token repair

The September 17 audit reproduced false routing across unrelated weather and billing operations.
The defect exists in codemode 0.4.2, 0.5.1, 0.5.2, and the tested upstream main revision.
[Cloudflare #2296](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/issues/2296) owns the upstream repair.
The source record is `improvements/canonical-source/cs-001-codemode-search-short-token-prefix.md`.
Raven also has an ungated copy of the same prefix rule.

Reverse-prefix deletion lost valid word-form matches and failed routing coverage.
Standard Porter stemming also failed coverage and doubled local search time in the measured implementation.
Neither experiment ships. Do not replace them with query exceptions or a tuned token-length threshold.

Done when: an upstream or general local repair passes the original triggers, positive controls, and Raven routing gates.
Keep the RWA exclusion until its three technical controls also pass.

### Revisit general directory admission after the rejected D3 experiment

The September 17 D3 deletion failed the predeclared answer gate and did not ship.
The candidate omitted the no-transcript warning present in the baseline A/V answer.
Both arms reached the same source. The experiment does not establish a causal routing regression.
The current directory field-placement exception remains a known design risk.
Do not repeat D3 or add entity-specific exceptions to make its examples pass.

Done when: a general mechanism passes frozen routing controls and independently reviewed answer checks.
Evidence: `research/audits/2026-09-17-routing-audit/m1-c1-passkeys-loss-review.md` and the September 17 round ledger.

### Reconcile source-authority guidance for full-description clients

The September 17 audit found conflicting instructions in `EXECUTE_DESCRIPTION` and `AUTHORITY_RULES`.
The former says all factual questions use Docs first. The latter assigns ecosystem facts to Scout or Lumenloop.
The conflicting clause falls beyond Claude's 2,048-character tool-description clip.
A clipped-client QA run cannot measure its correction.

Use the existing source-family rule when removing the contradictory clause.
Measure a full-description client or Playground against protocol and ecosystem controls before release.
Do not add operation lists, entity examples, or a new routing field.
Evidence: `research/audits/2026-09-17-routing-audit/direction-review.md`, section 8.

The existing Playground runner lacks answer-cost accounting and a judge dollar cap.
Its call-count controls cannot certify the proposed $20 comparison limit.
Keep that comparison unlaunched until existing budget enforcement covers both costs.
Do not add a parallel evaluation runner or treat an estimated cost as an enforced limit.

Done when: one consistent authority rule reaches the relevant client, with no verified answer regression.

### Reconcile Soroswap API and contract scope in sibling grader notes

The September 17 golden audit found ambiguous SDEX routing notes in two sibling cases.
Review `q-eco-dex-saturation` and `q-defi-soroswap-vs-stellarx` through the golden-truth workflow.
Soroswap API quotes can include SDEX. Its deployed aggregator currently lists three AMM adapters.
Do not treat those surfaces as identical.

Done when: independently verified notes preserve this distinction, and the corpus and sibling checks pass.

### Monitor Raven capability-boundary offers

Case `q-n3-missing-funds-account-support` offered a later Raven lookup by G-address or transaction
hash. Raven exposes no account-scoped lookup. The answer was a no-tool answer. Control case
`q-jutsu-check-account-history` asks for public lookup guidance that another service can perform.
A valid mechanism must not suppress that guidance.

The rejected capability-boundary Method 1 added prose to `eval/qa/run-qa.mjs:agentPrompt`. Its
environment pin differed, so it is invalid as a measurement. Its five-track T3 safety failure is
one observation. The prompt mechanism was withdrawn. The capability-boundary Method 2 was the
deterministic sample-30 headline with an offline plan regrade. It did not run. Both
capability-boundary authorizations are spent. The five-track Method 2 is separate and complete.

The free evidence record is
`.agents/rounds/2026-09-01-next-actionable-blocks/raven-free-evidence.md`. Its all-answer screen
scanned 338 local result files, 4,891 rows, and 2,406 answers. It adjudicated 51 high-recall offer
candidates. Six offers were unsupported, and no additional unsupported offer appeared. Its
separate no-tool screen scanned 44 explicit no-tool answers and adjudicated 17 candidates. The
same six offers remain unsupported. Five repeat this trap case. One appears in the Friendbot case.
No direct shipped prose advertises an account or transaction lookup. The generated micro-map gives
Data/RPC documentation and skill guidance, but does not expose an account query. The evidence
shows repeated QA behavior, but it does not identify a shipped Raven cause.

The `--expect-agent-environment-sha256` guard now fails before any answering-agent or judge call.
Matching runs stamp the expected and observed identities. Its CLI tests cover a match and every
rejected flag form. Rejected stored-judge and collection runs record zero paid-call attempts.

The owner selected monitor-only on 2026-09-03. Muse Spark 1.3, Fable 5.1, and Kimi K3 independently
supported that classification. No active diagnostic or product change remains.

Reopen a free cause audit after any production occurrence, any transcript showing an attempted
account-scoped operation, or any direct model-facing prose that advertises the capability. A third
distinct QA case can also reopen the free audit. It does not authorize a product change.

Candidate third case, recorded 2026-09-04 and not yet confirmed: in the stopped candidate artifact
`2026-09-04T05-40-51-variantA.json`, row `q-n3-wallet-hacked-support-redirect` offered to trace
funds through Horizon or Stellar Expert queries. Raven exposes no such operation. The row made no
tool call. The evidence is
`.agents/rounds/2026-09-03-truth-maintenance/candidate-row-review-skills-none-fable.md`. The same
artifact repeats the known trap case and shows capability self-descriptions such as "network state"
in five correct refusals. The owner decides whether this row is the third distinct case. A
confirmed trigger allows a free cause audit only.

Any later plan must name the surface owner and an observable product hypothesis. It must use a
mechanism that reaches no-tool answers. Another QA-prompt wording layer is spent. Do not copy case
facts, identifiers, or redirect lists into a prompt. Include the trap, the control, the environment
pin, and a pre-registered product gate.

The design record from closed PR #103 is at commit `fb9a35eb`. Fetch it with
`git fetch origin pull/103/head` if needed. Its result artifact is not a durable baseline.

Authorization boundary: a fired trigger allows free scans, inventory, plan writing, and independent
plan review. A focused diagnostic needs its own bounded authorization. A headline sample needs a
separate authorization after the focused diagnostic passes. Denominators never merge.

Done when: the owner retires the monitor, or a fired trigger leads to a reviewed resolution.

### Resolve paired-QA design before promotion

`qa-paired-ordinal-ni-v1` is implemented, experimental, and not a ship gate. No same-tuple pinned
pair exists. The 2026-08-30 artifact used rubric `v2.9`; the target rubric is `v2.10`. The
2026-09-04 candidate arm is non-comparable and cannot serve as one side of a pair.

The method requires 100 eligible IDs after five-track T4 and T5 exclusions. The validator reports a
99.356% terminal `INDETERMINATE` rate under its selected-100 missingness assumptions. The real run
lost one ID and returned `INDETERMINATE` at 99 eligible IDs. A candidate-only T4 also forces
`INDETERMINATE`; the validator reports 64.079% blocking under its 1% assumption.

Landed on 2026-09-04 with independent `PASS` reviews: the remote identity guard, the paired
collection supervisor `npm run eval:qa:paired:collect`, distinct cross-arm port pairs, stored-judge
identity stamps, and cumulative per-arm caps. The printer now requires one shared remote identity
vector, one probe hash, and different exact server revisions across arms. Commit `1847ffd` then
enforced the v2 launch contract. The plan schema is `qa-paired-collection-plan-v2`. The launch
requires an external authorized canonical plan SHA-256. The plan freezes every paid command array
and the flip Claude pins. It binds a fixed capacity contract with 24-hour freshness. It requires
exactly 200 selected and 500 active corpus IDs. The final Opus confirmation grants `LAUNCH-OK`
after the repairs at `352e517`. See
`.agents/rounds/2026-09-03-truth-maintenance/final-launch-contract-review-opus.md`.
The full contract is in `eval/qa/README.md` and `eval/EVALS.md` item 12.

The free two-agent capacity check is complete. The authoritative v2 `PASS` artifact is recorded in
`.agents/rounds/2026-09-03-truth-maintenance/paired-capacity-check-terra.md`. It expires at
`2026-09-05T10:25:17.815Z`. A launch after that time needs a fresh artifact.

Permitted now: free validator work on a pre-registered selected denominator above 100. Also
permitted: a fresh free capacity artifact for the chosen launch window. Revision 3 has its
independent confirmation. Review denominator and candidate-only rules before the first new look. Never
change either rule after reading a paid look.

The spend trigger is a signed authorization for the revised method in
`.agents/rounds/2026-09-03-truth-maintenance/revised-impact-measurement-fable.md`, plus the
recorded owner margin decision. Do not collect a pair for calibration alone under any other plan.
The revised method caps a 200-ID supervised pair at `$273.50`. The earlier `$82` same-tuple
estimate covered a 100-ID sequential pair and is superseded for planning.

Before the next collection, decide whether the optional one-row rubric `v2.10` rejudge of
`q-eco-stellar-wallets-list` is still useful. It is judge-contract evidence only and needs its own
small authorization.

Done when: two complete arms share the answering model, judge model, rubric, pack, pinned register,
environment hash, agent binary, implementation hash, probe hash, and remote identity vector. At
least 100 IDs remain eligible. Then
`npm run eval:qa:paired:validate -- --recalibrate <baseline> <candidate>` passes, and a round ledger
records the promotion decision.

### Execute the supervised paired subset only after a signed authorization

Trigger only when the round ledger carries the complete signed authorization block from
`.agents/rounds/2026-09-03-truth-maintenance/revised-impact-measurement-fable.md` revision 3,
an independent `LAUNCH-OK` review of that revision, the ten owner decisions including the
concurrent-load acceptance, and one clean launch revision. The signed record lives outside the
plan. It names the canonical plan SHA-256 from `npm run eval:qa:paired:plan-sha256`. The owner
signature covers that hash and every command array in the plan. The owner's general approval of
paid work for the round is not this authorization. Revision 1 and revision 2 received
`CHANGES-REQUIRED`. The appended final Opus confirmation grants `LAUNCH-OK` for revision 3
after repair. This verdict does not grant paid authority.

The method is one supervised 200-ID answer-only pair, stored judging one arm after the other, one
paired comparison, and two frozen flip rejudge commands with `--allow-empty` and Claude identity
pins. Caps: P6 `$3.50`; collection `$80` per arm; stored judging cumulative `$120` per arm;
two-arm cumulative `$240`; flip rejudges `$15` each; maximum `$273.50`. The plan uses
`qa-paired-collection-plan-v2`. The launch command carries `--authorized-plan-sha256`. The
capacity artifact must be at most 24 hours old at launch. The manifest stays uncommitted and is
deleted after the run.

Done when: the paired JSON, both flip batches, the recalibrated simulator output, and the all-row
review are recorded in the round ledger and `eval/qa/README.md` as a labeled paired diagnostic, or
the owner records `NOT AUTHORIZED`.

### Select harness follow-ups from the 2026-09-04 candidate audit

Owner judgment. These candidates are recorded, not scheduled. The owner selects or declines each.
The evidence is `.agents/rounds/2026-09-03-truth-maintenance/post-candidate-measurement-fable.md`
and `candidate-row-review-skills-none-fable.md`.

- Store per-row start and end timestamps and a per-row identity vector in the result schema.
- Record per-turn cost in `agent.usage.perTurn`.
- Add a serialization hint to the sandbox error path.
- Randomize row order or interleave categories in long live runs.
- Give the judge source-basis evidence on stable rows, or state that stable-row specifics are
  unverifiable.
- Remove the stable-row gate that hides wrong-claim rows from `evidenceSupportCheck`.
- Treat boundary rows skipped by the panel cap as low confidence in flip analysis.
- Add a harness metric for planning text that leaks into final answers.
- Record capability self-description drift in zero-tool refusals.

Done when: each candidate has an owner decision, and each selected candidate has its own item.

### Monitor Friendbot network-context synthesis

Case `q-edge-send-me-free-xlm` called Friendbot Testnet-only. The transcript made no tool call.
Stellar Docs expose Testnet, Futurenet, and local Quickstart distinctions. This is one answering
failure, not an upstream finding or a prompt-repair decision.

The same case was wrong again in the 2026-09-04 candidate artifact. The answer omitted Futurenet
and local Quickstart. The skills shard disputes the avoid-1 match because the answer did not say
"Testnet-only". A repeat of the same case does not fire this monitor.

Done when: the same wording defect appears in a second unrelated case, a contract mismatch appears,
or trace evidence shows the prompt requests the wrong behavior. An unrelated case uses a different
question family and primary service. A paraphrase of the first case does not count. Record every
recurrence with its case ID, result stamp, and transcript.

### Monitor the Stellar Docs title-set size against the remote identity probe ceiling

The remote identity probe `eval/qa/probe-remote-identities.mjs` enumerates the public Docs
`lvl1` title set through Algolia. The public key clamps pages to 100 records and the index limits
pagination to 1,000 records. The probe fails closed above ten pages. The live set held 650 records
on 2026-09-04. The record is the R4 item in
`.agents/rounds/2026-09-03-truth-maintenance/remote-identity-guard-review-opus.md`.

During each drift round, record the current title count from `inventory/stellar-docs-titles.json`.
Open a design item for a different enumeration strategy before the count reaches 1,000. A larger
page count cannot help because the index limit is the same.

Done when: a reviewed enumeration change removes the ceiling, or the owner retires the guard.

## Deferred programs

### Re-evaluate Scout exposure after a routing-contract change

Trigger only when a new Scout inventory changes `GET /api/quality` or `GET /api/verify`
`x-routing`, description, request schema, or response schema. A version-only change does not trigger
this work.

Before an exposure candidate, rebuild the catalog and generated surfaces. Run the focused exposure
tests and `npm run eval:routing -- --gate` without changing `eval/gates.json`. Compare the candidate
against the current accepted 1.9.52 surface. Record the manifest hash and all routing lane totals.

Two candidates were rejected with records. Scout 1.9.23 on 2026-09-03:
`.agents/rounds/2026-09-03-truth-maintenance/final-routing-review-terra.md`. Scout 1.9.30 on
2026-09-04: `.agents/rounds/2026-09-03-truth-maintenance/scout-1.9.30-drift-terra.md`. The 1.9.23
review found `scout.verifyClaim` causes no routing regression on its own, but it may ship only
after the general Scout routing regressions receive an independent resolution.

Done when: a changed routing contract passes the existing gate and an independent review accepts the
exposure decision. Otherwise, keep both operations in `EXCLUDED_SCOUT_OPS`.

### Keep `sources.locate` deferred

The owner deferred the program on 2026-08-28. The design and reopen rule live in
`ideas/source-delivery-ranked-references.md` section 8. Its twelve design questions are not current
owner questions.

Every verified incident must prove source coverage rather than routing, answer craft, judge error,
or golden error. It must meet all four section 8 conditions. Condition 3 requires live
repository-recovery steering. No such steering is live because recovery v2 was rejected.

Log incidents that meet conditions 1, 2, and 4 in the recovery item. Do not count them until
condition 3 is satisfied. No trigger authorizes implementation.

Done when: the full section 8 trigger fires and the owner approves a phase-zero study, or the owner
retires the program.

## Owner decisions

Owner decisions that block agent work are listed once, in `NEXT.md` under "Owner decisions".
Record each answer there or in `eval/qa/README.md`, then delete the question.

## Usage archive follow-up

### Verify scheduled collection and cleanup

After the collector release, verify the next scheduled canary and daily retention cleanup in private storage.
The hourly usage-health workflow detects stale canaries and possible collection gaps.
Keep production counts and request identifiers out of this public task queue.

Done when: private operational checks confirm the scheduled canary and cleanup succeeded.

### Public history rewrite: closed without rewriting

Decided 2026-09-17: the public Git history is not rewritten. GitHub organization ruleset 13736865
blocked the reviewed force-push, and the owner chose to move on with a clean current tree instead.
Older commits and PRs #151 through #155 still show the removed files. The plan, ref maps, and
reviewer verdicts are kept in the private `stellar-raven-aux-priv-evidence` directory under `history-rewrite/`.

Done.
