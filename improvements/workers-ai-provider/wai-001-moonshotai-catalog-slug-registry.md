upstreamTitle: workers-ai-provider rejects the Unified Billing moonshotai/Kimi catalog slug before AI.run
evidence:
  - workers-ai-provider 4.0.0 installed from npm (latest dist-tag, verified 2026-08-06)
  - deterministic local reproduction: `createWorkersAI({ binding, providers: [openai], resume: false })("moonshotai/kimi-k3")` throws before the mock binding's `run` is called (0 calls)
  - registry exports 26 entries; `moonshotai` is absent, while `findProviderBySlug("moonshotai")` returns undefined
  - source: node_modules/workers-ai-provider/src/gateway-delegate.ts:112-120 resolves slugs and throws the reproduced error
  - consumer impact: src/demo/model-config.ts:148-164 and src/demo/chat.ts:315-360 need a separate providers-less createWorkersAI instance to use the binding run path
  - upstream issue filed 2026-08-07: https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/issues/634
  - candidate fix https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/pull/639 remains open at head b57a507cd4a4e0eb8b2330196b75477c8eddfc64 (verified 2026-09-09); review is required and no checks are reported
recurrences:
  - date: 2026-08-11
    evidence: npm latest remains workers-ai-provider 4.0.0. The local minimal reproduction still throws Unknown gateway provider "moonshotai" before the mock binding run method is called; calls remains 0.
  - date: 2026-09-09
    evidence: At 02:44:10.820Z, the installed 4.0.0 package reproduced Unknown gateway provider "moonshotai" with zero mocked binding calls. npm latest remains 4.0.0. PR 639 adds the registry entry but is not merged or published. All 16 Raven demo model-config tests passed; these checks do not validate the candidate package.

## Finding

`workers-ai-provider` 4.0.0 cannot delegate the Unified Billing catalog slug
`moonshotai/kimi-k3` when provider plugins are configured. The 26-entry gateway
registry omits `moonshotai`, so model construction throws
`Unknown gateway provider "moonshotai" (from slug "moonshotai/kimi-k3")` before
`AI.run` can dispatch it. The current npm `latest` is also 4.0.0, so this is not
an upgrade-only issue.

## Evidence

Minimal reproduction (no network call):

```ts
import { createWorkersAI } from "workers-ai-provider";
import { openai } from "workers-ai-provider/openai";

let calls = 0;
const binding = { async run() { calls++; throw new Error("should not run"); } };
const workersai = createWorkersAI({ binding, providers: [openai], resume: false });

workersai("moonshotai/kimi-k3");
// GatewayDelegateError: Unknown gateway provider "moonshotai" ...
// calls === 0
```

Expected: the slug selects the run transport and reaches `binding.run`, as it does
when `providers` is omitted. Actual: the delegate rejects it during registry
resolution. Raven keeps a second, providers-less instance solely for this prefix;
that sacrifices the provider-SDK normalization and gateway-delegate features for
Kimi while the primary instance remains configured for other vendors.

PR [#639](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/pull/639) adds the proposed registry entry
and a provider patch changeset. Its `gateway-core` package is private and source-bundled;
it does not require a separate public package release. The PR remains a candidate fix.
Keep the workaround until a published package passes the local reproduction and consumer tests.

## Recommendation

Add a `moonshotai` registry entry for the Unified Billing run catalog using the
OpenAI wire format (the default `runWireFormat`) and mark it as having no native
gateway path unless Cloudflare supports one. This keeps the existing delegate
behavior for configured providers and removes the separate binding instance.
