## Finding

The Lumens and Accounts pages group traditional-asset and pool-share trustlines as account
subentries. Neither page states the important reserve exception. A pool-share trustline counts as
two subentries and requires two base reserves.

The Liquidity Pools page states the two-reserve rule. CAP-0038 defines the same rule. A reader who
uses only the general account pages can treat every trustline as one reserve unit.

This finding is distinct from resolved finding `sd-043` in `improvements/resolved.json`.
That finding removed selling liabilities from the minimum-balance formula.
This finding concerns the subentry multiplier for pool-share trustlines.

## Evidence

The four current sources were read on 2026-08-30. The Liquidity Pools page says that a pool-share
trustline requires two base reserves instead of one. CAP-0038 says the entry counts as two
subentries and therefore requires two base reserves.

The Lumens and Accounts pages use broader subentry lists. They do not state this exception beside
their trustline wording. The split makes the general pages incomplete for minimum-balance work.

## Recommendation

Add the pool-share exception beside the trustline item on both general pages. State that a normal
asset trustline adds one reserve unit. State that a pool-share trustline adds two reserve units.

Link the exception to the Liquidity Pools page. Keep the account formula consistent with CAP-0038
and the existing Liquidity Pools explanation.
