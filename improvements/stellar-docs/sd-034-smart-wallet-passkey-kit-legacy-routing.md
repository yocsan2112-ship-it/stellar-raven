    evidence: Live smart-wallet guidance still names only Passkey Kit and links the archived kalepail/passkey-kit move pointer; response SHA-256 a31347abd00f32d9558c3ceeaa543acb81ab5a38996e3c4fc3deb9132ece111b. PR #2367 restarted at head bdc081d9c25d2e2db6f674b8b61421a4f2bf32cd with passing checks and canonical kit links on its branch, but the combined six-page tutorial remains at bot:needs-decision after its author selected the current ElliotFriend companion: https://github.com/stellar/stellar-docs/pull/2367#issuecomment-5587369224. Issue #2700 remains open.

    evidence: "Live recheck of https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/guides/contract-accounts/smart-wallets. The page still omits Smart Account Kit and still links 'Code: github.com/kalepail/passkey-kit', which is archived and titled '[MOVED -> github.com/stellar/passkey-kit]'. The served skill defect was repaired and retired as sk-017 in improvements/resolved.json. The Docs defect remains independent."

    evidence: live smart-wallet and Guestbook source recheck still links archived kalepail/passkey-kit and omits Smart Account Kit, while Guestbook still requires LaunchTube. Issue #2700 remains open; its only recorded comment is Raven's 2026-08-05 premise correction, so no maintainer response exists.

## Finding

The current Stellar smart-wallet guide routes a greenfield reader to Passkey
Kit without presenting the separate Smart Account Kit authorization model.
Both kits are currently maintained sibling projects, not a legacy/successor
pair and not drop-in compatible: Passkey Kit uses its flat `Signatures` model,
while Smart Account Kit builds on OpenZeppelin context rules, auth digests,
signers, and policies.

The original filing premise expired after the README rewrite and repository
transfer. The remaining documentation gap is model selection and
component-specific review scope. This remains distinct from
`sd-027`, which concerns the discontinued LaunchTube submitter and indexing
role.

The still-open upstream issue predates that correction. It therefore remains
the upstream tracker, but its premise must be amended rather than copied into
a fix.

## Evidence

The 2026-08-04 recheck compared the current guide, both canonical repositories,
and OpenZeppelin account documentation. The direct reproduction URLs are:

- https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/guides/contract-accounts/smart-wallets
- https://github.com/stellar/passkey-kit
- https://github.com/stellar/smart-account-kit
- https://docs.openzeppelin.com/stellar-contracts/accounts/smart-account

## Recommendation

Present Passkey Kit and Smart Account Kit as current, separate choices and give
the shortest model-selection boundary: flat multi-signer `Signatures` versus
OpenZeppelin context-rule/auth-digest/policy authorization. Link both canonical
repositories, carry their current review/caveat language, and state audit scope
per exact artifact/release rather than implying the SDK, relayer, indexer,
frontend, policies, and deployment inherit one contract review.
