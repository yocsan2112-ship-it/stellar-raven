## Finding

`lumenloop.get_project` returns a record for `wisdomtree` that counts the
issuer's tokenized funds without naming any of them. The record states "13
digital funds and a Gold token" and names no fund. No returned match from the
tested semantic query names an individual fund ticker either.

The tested project, directory, and semantic calls did not return the named fund.
The directory holds the issuer and states the fund count, but these returned
matches do not name the products.

This is not a recurrence of `ll-012`. `ll-012` covers weak recall in broad RWA
discovery and its live/planned state mixing; its 2026-08-14 recurrence already
records the CRDT content-absence instance. This finding covers the naming depth
inside a successfully retrieved record. The count is present; the names are
not. That is a record-content gap, not a recall gap, so it takes its own id.

## Evidence

Results stamp `eval/qa/results/2026-08-28T19-27-08-variantA.json`, row
`q-defi-wisdomtree-crdt`.

Live re-execution on 2026-08-28:

- `lumenloop.get_project({slug:"wisdomtree"})` returned a 624-character record
  for WisdomTree Prime. It says "13 digital funds and a Gold token". The
  payload contains no `CRDT` or `CRDYX` substring.
- `lumenloop.search_directory({query:"CRDT"})` degraded to
  `match_mode: "semantic"` and returned five unrelated rows: DTCC, Stellar
  Router SDK, Decentrio, OrbitCDP, and DeFarm. "CRDT" is also a
  computer-science term.
- `lumenloop.search_content_semantic` over CRDT/CRDYX returned about thirty
  rows. None names either ticker. The closest row says "WisdomTree brings
  diversified tokenized portfolios to Stellar with 15 SEC-registered funds",
  with no per-fund ticker.

## Recommendation

Expose the named sub-products or token tickers already implied by the count, as
a `products[]` or `assets[]` array on the project record. The alternative is to
index one content row per named fund, so the semantic lane can reach it.

The exact issuer and SAC addresses that a fund question also needs are owned
elsewhere. This recommendation deliberately stops at naming the fund.
