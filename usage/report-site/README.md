# Private usage report

This directory contains public source code, not production usage data.
The private Sites deployment renders current aggregates and historical snapshots from the authenticated report API.
The browser receives no database credentials or account identifiers.
The report API requires its independent `REPORT_TOKEN` before every query.
Both API and Sites responses use `Cache-Control: no-store` for private data.

## Storage and metrics

D1 stores tool-response metadata for thirteen UTC monthly periods.
Counts include logged handler responses, including errors and refusals. They do not measure correctness or confirm delivery.
Authentication rejection and failures before response logging remain excluded.
The CLI and API share `cloudflare/queries.js`. Distinct account counts must not be added across months.
Historical snapshots have an explicit expiry. They remain separate from exact archived response records.

Production snapshots, account hashes, request identifiers, and audit exports must stay outside Git.
Only synthetic test fixtures belong in this directory. Credential scanning alone cannot enforce this data boundary.
Apply migration 0003 before deploying the report API or collector. Import trusted operator-generated launch JSON into D1 privately with bound parameters.
The fixed `/launch` endpoint requires the same authentication as `/report` and refuses expired snapshots.

## Development and release

Run `npm test`, `npm run check`, and `npm run build` in this directory.
Copy `env.example` to `.env` for local settings. Git ignores `.env`.
Sites uses `USAGE_REPORT_URL` and secret `USAGE_REPORT_TOKEN`; configure them through Sites environment settings.
The report Worker uses secret `REPORT_TOKEN`. Never use a Cloudflare or MCP token for this connection.

Change source through a Raven PR. After merge, sync clean main with `scripts/sync-usage-site.mjs`.
The owner's separate Sites checkout (`stellar-raven-aux-priv-report`) is a publication copy. Build and publish
its exact reviewed source through Sites. A fork creates its own Sites project and replaces `.openai/hosting.json`.
See `usage/README.md` for the full fork setup.
Confirm the owner-only access policy, authenticated dashboard refresh, launch report, and unauthenticated API rejection.
The hourly health workflow checks canary freshness and possible collection gaps. Tail delivery remains best effort.
